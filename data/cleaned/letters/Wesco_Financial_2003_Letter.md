As shown above, operating income includes signiÑcant net investment income,
representing dividends and interest earned from marketable securities. However,
operating income excludes investment gains of $34.8 million, net of income taxes,
realized in 2003. No investment gains were realized in 2002. The discussion belowwill concentrate on insurance underwriting, not on the results from investments.

Wes-FIC engages in the reinsurance business, occasionally insuring against lossfrom rare but horrendous ""super-catastrophes.'' In much reinsurance sold by us,
other Berkshire subsidiaries sold several times as much reinsurance to the samecustomers on the same terms. In certain instances but not always, such subsidiarieshave taken from us a 3%-of-premiums ceding commission on premium volumepassed through them to Wes-FIC. Excepting this ceding commission, Wes-FIC hashad virtually no insurance-acquisition or insurance administration costs. In somecases, other Berkshire subsidiaries act as reinsurers at higher levels than the level atwhich Wes-FIC is reinsuring; terms of the reinsurance are considered by Wes-FIC tobe fair or advantageous to Wes-FIC.
Underwriting results of Wes-FIC in 2003 were weirdly favorable, causing theunderwriting gain of $15.7 million. Such weirdly favorable results are not to beexpected over the long term. It should be recalled that Wes-FIC reported anunderwriting loss of $8.1 million as recently as 2001. However, we do try to createsome underwriting gain as results are averaged out over many years.
Kansas Bankers was purchased by Wes-FIC in 1996 for approximately $80 mil-
lion in cash. Its tangible net worth now exceeds its acquisition price, and it has beena very satisfactory acquisition, reÖecting the sound management of President Don
Towle and his team.
Kansas Bankers was chartered in 1909 to underwrite deposit insurance for
Kansas banks. Its oCces are in Topeka, Kansas. Over the years its service hascontinued to adapt to the changing needs of the banking industry. Today itscustomer base, consisting mostly of small and medium-sized community banks, isspread throughout 28 mainly midwestern states. In addition to bank deposit guarantybonds which insure deposits in excess of FDIC coverage, KBS oÅers directors andoCcers indemnity policies, bank employment practices policies, bank insuranceagents professional errors and omissions indemnity policies and Internet bankingcatastrophe theft insurance.
KBS increased the volume of business retained eÅective in 1998. It hadpreviously ceded almost half of its premium volume to reinsurers. Now it reinsuresonly about 11%. The increased volume of business retained comes, of course, withincreased irregularity in the income stream.
The combined ratio of an insurance company represents the percentage that itsunderwriting losses and expenses bear to its premium revenues. KBS's combinedratio has been much better than average for insurers, at 65.0% for 2003 and 71.3%
for 2002. We continue to expect volatile but favorable long-term eÅects fromincreased insurance retained.
CORT Business Services Corporation (""CORT'')
In February 2000, Wesco purchased CORT Business Services Corporation
(""CORT'') for $386 million in cash.

CORT is a very long established company that is the country's leader in rentalsof furniture that lessees have no intention of buying. In the trade, people call CORT'sactivity ""rent-to-rent'' to distinguish it from ""lease-to-purchase'' businesses that are,
in essence, installment sellers of furniture.
However, just as Hertz, as a rent-to-rent auto lessor in short-term arrangements,
must be skilled in selling used cars, CORT must be and is skilled in selling usedfurniture.
CORT's revenues totaled $360 million for calendar 2003, versus $389 million forcalendar 2002. Of these amounts, furniture rental revenues were $276 million and
$309 million, furniture sales revenues were $68 million and $73 million, andapartment locator fees of Relocation Central Corporation, a subsidiary CORT startedup in 2001, were $16 million and $7 million. CORT operated at an after-tax loss of
$6.3 million for 2003; it contributed $2.4 million and $13.1 million to Wesco'sconsolidated operating income for 2002 and 2001. These Ñgures are signiÑcantlyworse than CORT's $29 million of after-tax operating proÑts for the ten months thatwe owned it in 2000. Recent years were terrible in the ""rent-to-rent'' segment of thefurniture rental business. The Ñgures are before (1) goodwill amortization of zero forand 2002 (see discussion below), $6.0 million for 2001 and $5.1 million for
2000, and (2) realized securities losses of $.7 million in 2000, but include Relocation
Central's after-tax losses, less minority interest, of $9.0 million for 2003, $8.3 millionfor 2002 and $7.0 million for 2001. Excluding the operating losses of Relocation
Central, CORT, at the parent company level, contributed $2.7 million to Wesco'sconsolidated after-tax operating earnings for 2003, versus $10.7 million for 2002 and
$20.1 million for 2001.
When we purchased CORT early in 2000, its furniture rental business wasrapidly growing, reÖecting the strong U.S. economy, phenomenal business expansionand explosive growth of IPOs and the high-tech sector. Beginning late in 2000,
however, new business coming into CORT began to decline. With the burst of thedot-com bubble, the events of September 11, and continued weakness of job growthin the economy, CORT's operations have been hammered. Obviously, when wepurchased CORT we were poor predictors of near-term industry-wide prospects ofthe ""rent-to- rent'' sector of the furniture business.
Moreover, CORT started up a new subsidiary during 2001, Relocation Central
Corporation, which has developed a virtual call center and carries out an Internet-
based furniture and apartment-leads operation (www.relocationcentral.com), and itmarkets CORT's furniture rental services to real estate investment trusts, owners ofmany major apartment communities. As a result of the acquisition of its largestcompetitor in December 2002, followed by some oCce closures, Relocation Centraloperates in 15 metropolitan cities in fourteen states. CORT is hopeful that, through
Relocation Central, it will ultimately become the principal source of rental furnitureto the apartment industry, but this outcome is far from certain. Its operations shouldbe considered as still in a ""start-up'' phase. CORT has recently begun the process ofreorganizing Relocation Central's operations, including relocating various of its

facilities into CORT's, withdrawing from markets having unsatisfactory potential, andaggressively trimming its expenses, in an attempt to improve its operations, which sofar have not been satisfactory. The results of its operations have been consolidatedwith those reported for CORT, shown above.
We expect to report in due course that all CORT operations have become moresatisfactory. CORT has operated at a positive cash Öow and the general distress in its
Ñeld has permitted various small expansions. During the past three years it invested
$61 million in business expansion through acquisitions of several small businessesand reduced its line-of-credit and other debt by $50 million. CORT remains thenational leader in its market segment and would not be making these acquisitions ifwe believed its furniture rental business prospects were permanently impaired.
When Wesco paid $386 million for CORT, about 60% of the purchase price wasattributable to goodwill, an intangible balance sheet asset.
Wesco's consolidated balance sheet now contains about $267 million in good-
will (including $27 million from Wesco's 1996 purchase of KBS). The Financial
Accounting Standards Board adopted a rule which became eÅective in 2002 that nolonger requires automatic amortization of acquired goodwill. (The requirement forsuch amortization has been replaced by a standard that requires an annual assess-
ment to determine whether the value of goodwill has been impaired, in which eventthe intangible would be written down or written oÅ, as appropriate.) The earningswe have reported for 2002 and 2003, without deduction of any goodwill amortiza-
tion, more closely reÖect microeconomic reality as we appraise it.
More details with respect to CORT are contained throughout this annual report,
to which your careful attention is directed.
CORT has long been headed by Paul Arnold, age 57, who is a star executive as isconvincingly demonstrated by his long record as CEO of CORT. We are absolutelydelighted to have Paul and CORT within Wesco. We continue to expect a considera-
ble expansion of CORT's business and earnings at some future time.
Precision Steel Warehouse, Inc. (""Precision Steel'')
The businesses of Wesco's Precision Steel subsidiary, headquartered in theoutskirts of Chicago at Franklin Park, Illinois, operated at an after-tax loss of
$.9 million in 2003, versus an after-tax proÑt of $.3 million in 2002. The 2003 ÑgurereÖects $.7 million, after taxes, expensed in connection with environmental cleanupof an industrial park where a Precision Steel subsidiary has operated alongsideapproximately 15 other manufacturers for many years. Had it not been for theenvironmental matter or for LIFO inventory accounting adjustments, Precision Steelwould have reported an operating loss of $.2 million, after taxes, for 2003, versusafter-tax proÑts of $.1 million for 2002. We do not regard earnings changes fromenvironmental cleanup or LIFO accounting adjustments, up or down, as material inpredicting future earning power.

The U.S. steel industry has generally been a disaster since 2000, and Precision
Steel has suÅered worse eÅects than occurred for it in previous general declines inthe U.S. steel business.
Precision Steel has suÅered a signiÑcant reduction in demand for steel combinedwith intensiÑed competition above the Ñerce level encountered in each prior year.
Some of the sales reduction is caused by customers' (or former customers')
unsuccessful competition with manufacturers outside the United States. The severityof the domestic downturn is demonstrated by the fact that Precision Steel's averageannual steel service revenues for the years 2001 through 2003 were down 27% fromthose reported for 1998 through 2000. It has not reported satisfactory operatingresults in recent years; ignoring environmental-cleanup costs and LIFO adjustments,
its approximately-break-even operations for 2002 and 2003 compare very unfavora-
bly with operating proÑts which averaged $2.3 million, after taxes, for the years 1998
through 2000. Very recently, the cost of Precision Steel's raw materials rose sharplyin price.
Supplies of steel, which have generally been available to Precision Steel, are nolonger easy to obtain. The market has drifted into near chaos caused by shortages. Itis not clear how this is going to work out. Early in 2004, prices and proÑts are higherat Precision Steel, but longer-term eÅects are far from clear.
Terry Piper, who became Precision Steel's President and Chief Executive OCcerlate in 1999, has done an excellent job in leading Precision Steel through diCcultyears.
Tag Ends from Savings and Loan Days
All that now remains outside Wes-FIC but within Wesco as a consequence of
Wesco's former involvement with Mutual Savings, Wesco's long-held savings andloan subsidiary, is a small real estate subsidiary, MS Property Company, that holds tagends of appreciated real estate assets with a net book value of about $6.4 million,
consisting mainly of the nine-story commercial oCce building in downtown
Pasadena, where Wesco is headquartered. MS Property Company's results of opera-
tions, immaterial versus Wesco's present size, are included in the breakdown ofearnings on page 1 within ""other operating earnings.''
Other Operating Earnings
Other operating earnings, net of interest paid and general corporate expenses,
amounted to $.4 million in 2003 and $.6 million in 2002. Sources were (1) rents
($3.2 million gross in 2003) from Wesco's Pasadena oCce property (leased almostentirely to outsiders, including Citibank as the ground Öoor tenant), and (2) interestand dividends from cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside theinsurance subsidiaries, less (3) general corporate expenses plus minor expensesinvolving tag-end real estate.

Consolidated Balance Sheet and Related Discussion
Wesco carries its investments at market value, with unrealized appreciation,
after income tax eÅect, included as a separate component of shareholders' equity,
and related taxes included in income taxes payable, in its consolidated balancesheet. As indicated in the accompanying Ñnancial statements, Wesco's net worth, asaccountants compute it under their conventions, increased to $2.1 billion ($292 per
Wesco share) at yearend 2003 from $1.96 billion ($275 per Wesco share) atyearend 2002. The main cause of increase was net income after deduction ofdividends paid to shareholders.
The foregoing $292-per-share book value approximates liquidation value assum-
ing that all Wesco's non-security assets would liquidate, after taxes, at book value.
Of course, so long as Wesco does not liquidate, and does not sell anyappreciated securities, it has, in eÅect, an interest-free ""loan'' from the governmentequal to its deferred income taxes on the unrealized gains, subtracted in determiningits net worth. This interest-free ""loan'' from the government is at this momentworking for Wesco shareholders and amounted to about $32 per Wesco share atyearend 2003.
However, some day, parts of the interest-free ""loan'' may be removed assecurities are sold. Therefore, Wesco's shareholders have no perpetual advantagecreating value for them of $32 per Wesco share. Instead, the present value of
Wesco's shareholders' advantage must logically be much lower than $32 per Wescoshare.
Business and human quality in place at Wesco continues to be not nearly asgood, all factors considered, as that in place at Berkshire Hathaway. Wesco is not anequally-good-but-smaller version of Berkshire Hathaway, better because its smallsize makes growth easier. Instead, each dollar of book value at Wesco continuesplainly to provide much less intrinsic value than a similar dollar of book value at
Berkshire Hathaway. Moreover, the quality disparity in book value's intrinsic meritshas, in recent years, continued to widen in favor of Berkshire Hathaway.
All that said, we make no attempt to appraise relative attractiveness for invest-
ment of Wesco versus Berkshire Hathaway stock at present stock-market quotations.
To progress from this point at a satisfactory rate, Wesco plainly needs morefavorable investment opportunities, recognizable as such by its management, prefer-
ably in whole companies, but, alternatively, in marketable securities to be purchasedby Wesco's insurance subsidiaries. Our views regarding the general prospects forinvestment in common stocks are unchanged one year after Warren BuÅett wrotethe following, in his 2002 annual report to shareholders of our parent company:
""We continue to do little in equities. ®We© are increasingly comfortablewith our holdings in ®our© major investees because most of them have in-
creased their earnings while their valuations have decreased. But we are not

inclined to add to them. Though these enterprises have good prospects, wedon't yet believe their shares are undervalued.
""In our view, the same conclusion Ñts stocks generally. Despite three yearsof falling prices, which have signiÑcantly improved the attractiveness of com-
mon stocks, we still Ñnd very few that even mildly interest us. That dismal fact istestimony to the insanity of valuations reached during The Great Bubble.
Unfortunately, the hangover may prove to be proportional to the binge.
""The aversion to equities that ®we© exhibit today is far from congenital. Welove owning common stocks Ì if they can be purchased at attractive prices. In
®my© 61 years of investing, 50 or so years have oÅered that kind of opportunity.
There will be years like that again. Unless, however, we see a very highprobability of at least 10% pre-tax returns (which translates to 61/2-7% aftercorporate tax), we will sit on the sidelines. With short-term money returning lessthan 1% after-tax, sitting it out is no fun. But occasionally successful investingrequires inactivity.''
In fact, the one thing that should interest Wesco shareholders most with respectto 2003 is that, as in 2002 and 2001, Wesco found no new common stocks for ourinsurance companies to buy.
The Board of Directors recently increased Wesco's regular dividend from 331/2
cents per share to 341/2 cents per share, payable March 3, 2004, to shareholders ofrecord as of the close of business on February 4, 2004.
Wesco now has a website: www.wescoÑnancial.com. Shareholders can thereaccess much Wesco information, including printed annual reports, earnings releases,
SEC Ñlings, and the websites of Wesco's subsidiaries and parent, Berkshire
Hathaway.
This annual report contains Form 10-K, a report Ñled with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, and includes detailed information about Wesco and itssubsidiaries as well as audited Ñnancial statements bearing extensive footnotes. Asusual, your careful attention is sought with respect to these items.
