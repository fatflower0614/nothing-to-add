This supplementary breakdown of earnings diÅers somewhat from that used inaudited Ñnancial statements which follow standard accounting convention. Thesupplementary breakdown is furnished because it is considered useful toshareholders.
Wesco-Financial Insurance Company (""Wes-FIC'')
Wes-FIC's normal net income for 1999 was $43,610,000, versus $34,654,000 for
1998. The Ñgures include $6,415,000 in 1999 and $4,987,000 in 1998 contributed by

The Kansas Bankers Surety Company (""KBS''), owned by Wes-FIC since 1996. KBS
is discussed in the section, ""The Kansas Bankers Surety Company,'' below.
At the end of 1999 Wes-FIC retained about $21 million in invested assets, oÅsetby claims reserves, from its former reinsurance arrangement with Fireman's Fund
Group. This arrangement was terminated August 31, 1989. However, it will take along time before all claims are settled, and, meanwhile, Wes-FIC is being helpedover many years by proceeds from investing ""Öoat.''
In addition, Wes-FIC has been engaged for several years in super-cat reinsur-
ance, described in great detail in our pre-1999 annual reports, which Wescoshareholders should re-read each year. Wes-FIC also engages in other reinsurancebusiness, including large and small quota share arrangements similar and dissimilar toour previous reinsurance contract with Fireman's Fund Group.
In all recent reinsurance sold by us, other subsidiaries of our 80%-owning parent,
Berkshire Hathaway, sold four times as much reinsurance to the same customers onthe same terms, except that such subsidiaries usually take from us a 3%-of-premiumsceding commission on premium volume passed through them to Wes-FIC. Exceptingthis ceding commission, Wes-FIC has virtually no insurance-acquisition or insuranceadministration costs.
Early in the current year (2000) Wes-FIC made an intracompany loan that fundsa large majority of the purchase price of CORT Business Services Corporation,
discussed below.
Wes-FIC remains a very strong insurance company, with very low costs, and,
one way or another, in the future as in the past, we expect to continue to Ñnd andseize at least a few sensible insurance opportunities.
On super-cat reinsurance accepted by Wes-FIC to date (March 3, 2000) therehas been no loss whatsoever that we know of, but some ""no-claims'' contingentcommissions have been paid to original cessors of business (i.e., cessors notincluding Berkshire Hathaway). Super-cat underwriting proÑt of $1.4 million a year,
before taxes, beneÑted earnings in 1999 and 1998. The balance of pre-tax underwrit-
ing proÑt amounted to $3.0 million for 1999 and $1.9 million for 1998. These Ñgurescame mostly from favorable revision of loss reserves on the old Fireman's Fundcontract.
Wesco shareholders should continue to realize that recent marvelous underwrit-
ing results are sure to be followed, sometime, by one or more horrible underwritinglosses from super-cat or other insurance written by Wes-FIC.
The Kansas Bankers Surety Company (""KBS'')
KBS, purchased by Wes-FIC in 1996 for approximately $80 million in cash,
contributed $6,415,000 to the normal net operating income of the insurancebusinesses in 1999 and $4,987,000 in 1998, after reductions for goodwill amortiza-
tion under consolidated accounting convention of $782,000 each year. The results of

KBS have been combined with those of Wes-FIC, and are included in the foregoingtable in the category, "" 'normal' net operating income of Wes-FIC and KBS insurancebusinesses.''
KBS was chartered in 1909 to underwrite deposit insurance for Kansas banks. ItsoCces are in Topeka, Kansas. Over the years its service has continued to adapt to thechanging needs of the banking industry. Today its customer base, consisting mostlyof small and medium-sized community banks, is spread throughout 25 mainlymidwestern states. In addition to bank deposit guaranty bonds which insure depositsin excess of FDIC coverage, KBS also oÅers directors and oCcers indemnity policies,
bank employment practices policies, bank annuity and mutual funds indemnitypolicies and bank insurance agents professional errors and omissions indemnitypolicies.
A signiÑcant change in KBS's operations occurred in 1998 and consisted of alarge reduction in insurance premiums ceded to reinsurers. The increased volume ofbusiness retained (95% in 1999 and 94% in 1998 compares with 58% in 1997)
accompanied slightly higher underwriting income for 1999 after a reduction in theamount for 1998. KBS's combined ratio remained much better than average forinsurers, at 59.4% for 1999 and 62.2% for 1998, versus 37.2% for 1997, and weexpect volatile but favorable long-term eÅects from increased insurance retained.
Part of KBS's continuing insurance volume is now ceded through reinsurance toother Berkshire subsidiaries under reinsurance arrangements whereunder such other
Berkshire subsidiaries take 50% and unrelated reinsurers take the other 50%.
KBS is run by Donald Towle, President, assisted by 15 dedicated oCcers andemployees.
CORT Business Services Corporation (""CORT'')
In February 2000, Wesco purchased 100% of CORT Business Services Corpora-
tion (""CORT'') for $384 million in cash. In addition, CORT retains about $45 millionof previously existing debt.
CORT is a very long established company that is the country's leader in rentalsof furniture that lessees have no intention of buying. In the trade, people call CORT'sactivity ""rent-to-rent'' to distinguish it from ""lease-to-purchase'' businesses that are,
in essence, installment sellers of furniture.
However, just as Hertz, as a rent-to-rent auto lessor in short-term arrangements,
must be skilled in selling used cars, CORT must be and is skilled in selling usedfurniture.
In 1999, CORT had total revenues of $354 million. Of this, $295 million wasfurniture rental revenue and $59 million was furniture sales revenue. CORT's pre-taxearnings in 1999 were $46 million.

Thus, in essence, Wesco paid $384 million for $46 million in pre-tax earnings.
About 60% of the purchase price was attributable to goodwill, an intangible balancesheet asset.
After the transaction, Wesco's consolidated balance sheet will contain about
$260 million in goodwill (including $29 million from Wesco's 1996 purchase of
Kansas Bankers Surety). On a full year basis, Wesco's future reported earnings willbe reduced by about $6 million on account of mostly-non-tax-deductible amortiza-
tion of goodwill. We do not believe, however, that this accounting deduction reÖectsany real deterioration in earnings-driving goodwill in place.
More details with respect to the CORT transaction are contained in Note 8 tothe accompanying Ñnancial statements, and on the last page of this annual report, towhich careful attention is directed.
CORT has long been headed by Paul Arnold, age 53, who is a star executive as isconvincingly demonstrated by his long record as CEO of CORT. Paul will continue as
CEO of CORT, with no interference from Wesco headquarters. We would be crazyto second-guess a man with his record in business. We are absolutely delighted tohave Paul and CORT within Wesco and hope to see a considerable expansion of
CORT's business and earnings in future years.
Precision Steel
The businesses of Wesco's Precision Steel subsidiary, headquartered in theoutskirts of Chicago at Franklin Park, Illinois, contributed $2,532,000 to normal netoperating income in 1999, compared with $3,154,000 in 1998. The $622,000
decrease in 1999 net income occurred despite a 2.5% increase in pounds of productsold, and reÖects mainly the pounding which competition gave to prices as costs ofprincipal raw materials declined. Fewer dollars of gross proÑt were available toabsorb operating expenses. Precision Steel's operations for 1999 and 1998 alsoreÖect after-tax expenditures of approximately $225,000 and $350,000, respectively,
necessitated to upgrade computers and computer systems to ensure that Precision
Steel's order-taking and other data processing systems continue to function accu-
rately beyond December 31, 1999.
It is with mixed emotions that we report that David Hillstrom, President and
Chief Executive oCcer of Precision Steel for more than twenty years, retired in thelatter part of 1999 and that Terry Piper was elected to replace him. Terry is a veryable man and is no stranger to Precision Steel. He joined it as a salesman approxi-
mately forty years ago, steadily advanced, and served as President and General
Manager of Precision Steel's Precision Brand Products subsidiary for the last thirteenyears. Terry now has the responsibility of carrying on the leadership of his predeces-
sor; and, under their combined skills, Precision Steel's businesses in 1999 continuedto provide an excellent return on resources employed.

Tag Ends from Savings and Loan Days
All that now remains outside Wes-FIC but within Wesco as a consequence of
Wesco's former involvement with Mutual Savings, Wesco's long-held savings andloan subsidiary, is a small real estate subsidiary, MS Property Company, that holds tagends of assets and liabilities with a net book value of about $15 million. MS Property
Company's results of operations, immaterial versus Wesco's present size, are in-
cluded in the foregoing breakdown of earnings within ""all other 'normal' netoperating income (loss).''
Of course, the main tag end from Wesco's savings and loan days is aninvestment in Freddie Mac common stock, purchased by Mutual Savings for $72 mil-
lion at a time when Freddie Mac shares could be lawfully owned only by a savingsand loan association. The 28,800,000 shares owned by Wes-FIC at yearend 1999 hada market value of $1.4 billion.
All Other ""Normal'' Net Operating Income or Loss
All other ""normal'' net operating income or loss, net of interest paid and generalcorporate expenses, amounted to after-tax losses of $238,000 in 1999 and $186,000
in 1998. Sources were (1) rents ($2,862,000 gross in 1999) from Wesco's PasadenaoCce property (leased almost entirely to outsiders, including California Federal Bankas the ground Öoor tenant), and (2) interest and dividends from cash equivalentsand marketable securities held outside the insurance subsidiaries, less (3) costs andexpenses of liquidating tag-end foreclosed real estate. The loss widened in 1999
because fewer dividends were received during the year after forced conversion ofpreferred stock of Citigroup Inc. (""Citigroup'') into lower-dividend-paying commonstock. The ""other 'normal' net operating income or loss'' Ñgures for 1999 and 1998
also include intercompany charges for interest expense ($353,000 and $102,000
after taxes, respectively) on borrowings from Wes-FIC. This intercompany interestexpense does not aÅect Wesco's consolidated net income inasmuch as the sameamount is included as interest income in Wes-FIC's ""normal'' net operating income.
""Other 'normal' net operating income or loss'' beneÑted in 1999 by about $800,000
caused by reversals of reserves for possible losses on sales of loans and tag-end realestate, expensed in prior years.
Net Securities Gains and Losses
Wesco's earnings contained securities gains of $7,271,000, after income taxes,
for 1999, versus $33,609,000, after taxes, for 1998.
Although the realized gains materially impacted Wesco's reported earnings foreach year, they had a very minor impact on Wesco's shareholders' equity. Inasmuch asthe greater portion of each year's realized gains had previously been reÖected in theunrealized gain component of Wesco's shareholders' equity, those amounts weremerely switched from unrealized gains to retained earnings, another component ofshareholders' equity.

Consolidated Balance Sheet and Related Discussion
As indicated in the accompanying Ñnancial statements, Wesco's net worthdecreased, as accountants compute it under their conventions, to $1.90 billion
($266 per Wesco share) at yearend 1999 from $2.22 billion ($312 per Wescoshare) at yearend 1998.
The $328.4 million decrease in reported net worth in 1999 was the result of
(1) $54.1 million from 1999 net income; less (2) a $374.1 million decrease in themarket value of investments after provision for future taxes on capital gains; and
(2) $8.4 million in dividends paid.
The foregoing $266-per-share book value approximates liquidation value assum-
ing that all Wesco's non-security assets would liquidate, after taxes, at book value.
Probably, this assumption is too conservative. But our computation of liquidationvalue is unlikely to be too low by more than two or three dollars per Wesco share,
because (1) the liquidation value of Wesco's consolidated real estate holdings
(where interesting potential now lies almost entirely in Wesco's equity in its oCceproperty in Pasadena containing only 125,000 net rentable square feet), and
(2) unrealized appreciation in other assets (primarily Precision Steel) cannot belarge enough, in relation to Wesco's overall size, to change very much the overallcomputation of after-tax liquidating value.
Of course, so long as Wesco does not liquidate, and does not sell anyappreciated assets, it has, in eÅect, an interest-free ""loan'' from the governmentequal to its deferred income taxes on the unrealized gains, subtracted in determiningits net worth. This interest-free ""loan'' from the government is at this momentworking for Wesco shareholders and amounted to about $99 per Wesco share atyearend 1999.
However, some day, perhaps soon, major parts of the interest-free ""loan'' mustbe paid as assets are sold. Therefore, Wesco's shareholders have no perpetualadvantage creating value for them of $99 per Wesco share. Instead, the presentvalue of Wesco's shareholders' advantage must logically be much lower than $99 per
Wesco share. In the writer's judgment, the value of Wesco's advantage from itstemporary, interest-free ""loan'' was probably about $20 per Wesco share at yearend
1999.
After the value of the advantage inhering in the interest-free ""loan'' is estimated,
a reasonable approximation can be made of Wesco's intrinsic value per share. Thisapproximation is made by simply adding (1) the value of the advantage from theinterest-free ""loan'' per Wesco share and (2) liquidating value per Wesco share.
Others may think diÅerently, but the foregoing approach seems reasonable to thewriter as a way of estimating intrinsic value per Wesco share.
Thus, if the value of the advantage from the interest-free tax-deferral ""loan'' was
$20 per Wesco share at yearend 1999, and after-tax liquidating value was then about
$266 per share (Ñgures that seem rational to the writer), Wesco's intrinsic value pershare would become about $286 per share at yearend 1999, down 16% from intrinsic

value as guessed in a similar calculation at the end of 1998. And, Ñnally, thisreasonable-to-this-writer, $286-per-share Ñgure for intrinsic per share value of
Wesco stock should be compared with the $245 per share price at which Wescostock was selling on December 31, 1999. This comparison indicates that Wescostock was then selling about 14% below intrinsic value.
Wesco's investment portfolio suÅered more than its commensurate share ofdecline in market value in 1999. Last year, we said ""as Wesco's unrealized apprecia-
tion has continued to grow in frothy markets for securities, it should be rememberedthat it is subject to market Öuctuation, possibly dramatic on the downside, with noguaranty as to its ultimate full realization .'' The stock of several of our largestinvestees lagged the market in 1999 by a large margin. It's no sure thing that thevalue of our marketable securities will quickly recover. Unrealized after-tax apprecia-
tion represented 69% of Wesco's shareholders' equity at 1999 yearend, versus 76%
and 73% one and two years earlier.
Business and human quality in place at Wesco continues to be not nearly asgood, all factors considered, as that in place at Berkshire Hathaway. Wesco is not anequally-good-but-smaller version of Berkshire Hathaway, better because its smallsize makes growth easier. Instead, each dollar of book value at Wesco continuesplainly to provide much less intrinsic value than a similar dollar of book value at
Berkshire Hathaway. Moreover, the quality disparity in book value's intrinsic meritshas, in recent years, been widening in favor of Berkshire Hathaway.
All that said, we make no attempt to appraise relative attractiveness for invest-
ment of Wesco versus Berkshire Hathaway stock at present stock-market quotations.
The Board of Directors recently increased Wesco's regular dividend from
29¥ cents per share to 30¥ cents per share, payable March 8, 2000, to shareholdersof record as of the close of business on February 9, 2000.
This annual report contains Form 10-K, a report Ñled with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, and includes detailed information about Wesco and itssubsidiaries as well as audited Ñnancial statements bearing extensive footnotes. Asusual, your careful attention is sought with respect to these items.
