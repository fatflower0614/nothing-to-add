Wesco-Financial Insurance Company (""Wes-FIC'')
Wes-FIC's normal net income for 1998 was $34,654,000, versus $33,507,000 for
1997. The Ñgures include $4,987,000 in 1998 and $6,044,000 in 1997 contributed by
The Kansas Bankers Surety Company (""KBS''), owned by Wes-FIC since 1996. KBS
is discussed in the section, ""The Kansas Bankers Surety Company,'' below.
At the end of 1998 Wes-FIC retained about $24 million in invested assets, oÅsetby claims reserves, from its former reinsurance arrangement with Fireman's Fund
Group. This arrangement was terminated August 31, 1989. However, it will take along time before all claims are settled, and, meanwhile, Wes-FIC is being helpedover many years by proceeds from investing ""Öoat.''
We previously informed shareholders that Wes-FIC had entered into the busi-
ness of super-cat reinsurance through retrocessions from the Insurance Group of
Berkshire Hathaway, Wesco's ultimate parent. Wes-FIC's entry into the super-catreinsurance business early in 1994 followed the large augmentation of its claims-
paying capacity caused by its merger with Mutual Savings, the former savings andloan subsidiary of Wesco. In 1994, in recognition of Wes-FIC's sound Ñnancialcondition, Standard and Poor's Corporation assigned to Wes-FIC the highest possibleclaims-paying-ability rating: AAA.
The super-cat reinsurance business, in which Wes-FIC is engaged, continues tobe a very logical business for Wes-FIC. Wes-FIC has a large net worth in relation toannual premiums being earned. And this is exactly the condition rationally requiredfor any insurance company planning to be a ""stand alone'' reinsurer covering super-
catastrophe risks it can't safely pass on to others sure to remain solvent if a largesuper-catastrophe comes. Such a ""stand alone'' reinsurer must be a kind of Fort
Knox, prepared occasionally, without calling on any other reinsurers for help, to payout in a single year many times more than premiums coming in, as it covers lossesfrom some super catastrophe worse than Hurricane Andrew. In short, it needs abalance sheet a lot like Wes-FIC's.
In connection with the retrocessions of super-cat reinsurance to Wes-FIC fromthe Berkshire Hathaway Insurance Group, the nature of the situation as it hasevolved is such that Berkshire Hathaway, owning 100% of its Insurance Group andonly 80% of Wesco and Wes-FIC, does not, for some philanthropic reason, ordinarilyretrocede to Wes-FIC any reinsurance business that Berkshire Hathaway considersdesirable and that is available only in amounts below what Berkshire Hathawaywants for itself on the terms oÅered. Instead, retrocessions occur only occasionally,
under limited conditions and with some compensation to Berkshire Hathaway. Suchretrocessions ordinarily happen only when (1) Berkshire Hathaway, for some reason
(usually a policy of overall risk limitation), desires lower amounts of business thanare available on the terms oÅered and (2) Wes-FIC has adequate capacity to bearthe risk assumed and (3) Wes-FIC pays a fair ceding commission designed to coverpart of the cost of getting and managing insurance business.

Generally, Berkshire Hathaway, in dealing with partly owned subsidiaries, triesto lean over a little backward in an attempt to observe what Justice Cardozo called
""the punctilio of an honor the most sensitive,'' but it cannot be expected to makelarge and plain giveaways of Berkshire Hathaway assets or business to a partiallyowned subsidiary like Wes-FIC.
Given Berkshire Hathaway's unwillingness to make plain giveaways to Wes-FIC
and reductions in opportunities in the super-cat reinsurance market in recent years,
prospects are often poor for Wes-FIC's acquisition of retroceded super-catreinsurance.
Moreover, Wesco shareholders should continue to realize that super-cat rein-
surance is not for the faint of heart. A huge variation in annual results, with some veryunpleasant future years for Wes-FIC, is inevitable.
But it is precisely what must, in the nature of things, be associated with thesebad possibilities, with their huge and embarrassing adverse consequences in occa-
sional years, that makes Wes-FIC like its way of being in the super-cat business.
Buyers (particularly wise buyers) of super-cat reinsurance often want to deal with
Berkshire Hathaway subsidiaries (possessing as they do the highest possible creditratings and a reliable corporate personality) instead of other reinsurers less cautious,
straightforward and well endowed. And many competing sellers of super-cat reinsur-
ance are looking for a liberal ""intermediary's'' proÑt, hard to get because they must
Ñnd a ""layoÅ'' reinsurer both (1) so smart that it is sure to stay strong enough to paypossible losses yet (2) so casual about costs that it is not much bothered by a liberalproÑt earned by some intermediary entity not willing to retain any major risk. Thusthe forces in place can rationally be expected to cause acceptable long-term resultsfor well-Ñnanced, disciplined decision makers, despite horrible losses in some yearsand other years of restricted opportunity to write business. And, again, we wish torepeat that we expect only acceptable long-term results. We see no possibility forbonanza.
It should also be noted that Wes-FIC, in the arrangements with the Insurance
Group of Berkshire Hathaway, receives a special business-acquisition advantagefrom using Berkshire Hathaway's general reputation. Under all the circumstances,
the 3% ceding commission now being paid seems more than fair to Wes-FIC.
Certainly and obviously, Berkshire Hathaway would not oÅer terms so good to anyother entity outside the Berkshire Hathaway aCliated group.
Finally, we repeat an important disclosure about Wes-FIC's super-cat-reinsur-
ance-acquisition mechanics. It is impractical to have people in California makecomplex accept-or-reject decisions for Wes-FIC when retrocessions of reinsuranceare oÅered by the Berkshire Hathaway Insurance Group. But, happily, the Berkshire
Hathaway Insurance Group executives making original business-acquisition deci-
sions are greatly admired and trusted by the writer and will be ""eating their owncooking.'' Under such circumstances, Wesco's and Wes-FIC's boards of directors, onthe writer's recommendation, have simply approved automatic retrocessions ofreinsurance to Wes-FIC as oÅered by one or more wholly owned Berkshire

Hathaway subsidiaries. Each retrocession is to be accepted forthwith in writing in
Nebraska by agents of Wes-FIC who are at the same time salaried employees ofwholly owned subsidiaries of Berkshire Hathaway. Moreover, each retrocession willbe made at a 3%-of-premiums ceding commission. Finally, two conditions must besatisÑed: (1) Wes-FIC must get 20% or less of the risk (before taking into accounteÅects from the ceding commission) and (2) wholly owned Berkshire Hathawaysubsidiaries must retain at least 80% of the identical risk (again, without taking intoaccount eÅects from the ceding commission).
We will not ordinarily describe individual super-cat reinsurance contracts in fulldetail to Wesco shareholders. That would be contrary to our competitive interest.
Instead, we will try to summarize reasonably any items of very large importance.
Will more reinsurance be later available to Wes-FIC through Berkshire
Hathaway subsidiaries on the basis and using the automatic procedure we haveabove described? Well, we have often proved poor prognosticators. We can only saythat we hope so and that more reinsurance should come, albeit irregularly and withlong intermissions. No new contracts became available to Wes-FIC in 1998. As ofyearend, the one remaining super-cat contract, plus one other contract, not asuper-cat contract, represented Wes-FIC's active reinsurance business.
We continue to examine other possible insurance-writing opportunities, andalso insurance company acquisitions, like and unlike the purchase of KBS.
Wes-FIC is now a very strong insurance company, with very low costs, and, oneway or another, in the future as in the past, we expect to continue to Ñnd and seize atleast a few sensible insurance opportunities.
On super-cat reinsurance accepted by Wes-FIC to date (March 8, 1999) therehas been no loss whatsoever that we know of, but some ""no-claims'' contingentcommissions have been paid to original cessors of business (i.e., cessors notincluding Berkshire Hathaway). Super-cat underwriting proÑt of $1.4 million, beforetaxes, beneÑted 1998 earnings, versus $2.3 million in 1997. The balance of pre-taxunderwriting proÑt amounted to $1.9 million for 1998 and $2.8 million for 1997.
These Ñgures came mostly from favorable revision of loss reserves on the old
Fireman's Fund contract.
The Kansas Bankers Surety Company (""KBS'')
KBS, purchased by Wes-FIC in 1996 for approximately $80 million in cash,
contributed $4,987,000 to the normal net operating income of the insurancebusinesses in 1998 and $6,044,000 in 1997, after reductions for goodwill amortiza-
tion under consolidated accounting convention of $782,000 each year. The results of
KBS have been combined with those of Wes-FIC, and are included in the foregoingtable in the category, "" 'normal' net operating income of Wes-FIC and KBS insurancebusinesses.''
KBS was chartered in 1909 to underwrite deposit insurance for Kansas banks. ItsoCces are in Topeka, Kansas. Over the years its service has continued to adapt to the

changing needs of the banking industry. Today its customer base, consisting mostlyof small and medium-sized community banks, is spread throughout 25 mainlymidwestern states. In addition to bank deposit guaranty bonds which insure depositsin excess of FDIC coverage, KBS also oÅers directors and oCcers indemnity policies,
bank employment practices policies, bank annuity and mutual funds indemnitypolicies and bank insurance agents professional errors and omissions indemnitypolicies.
The principal change in KBS's operations in 1998 was a large reduction ininsurance premiums ceded to reinsurers, eÅective January 1, 1998. The increasedvolume of business retained (94% in 1998 versus 58% in 1997) accompaniedreduced underwriting income during 1998. However, KBS's combined ratio re-
mained much better than average for insurers, at 62.2% for 1998, versus 37.2% forand 29.3% for 1996, and we expect volatile but favorable long-term eÅectsfrom increased insurance retained. Part of KBS's continuing insurance volume is nowceded through reinsurance to other Berkshire subsidiaries under reinsurance arrange-
ments whereunder such other Berkshire subsidiaries take 50% and unrelated reinsur-
ers take the other 50%.
KBS is run by Donald Towle, President, assisted by 15 dedicated oCcers andemployees.
Precision Steel
The businesses of Wesco's Precision Steel subsidiary, headquartered in theoutskirts of Chicago at Franklin Park, Illinois, contributed $3,154,000 to normal netoperating income in 1998, compared with $3,622,000 in 1997. The decrease in proÑtoccurred as revenues decreased 2%, despite a 5% increase in pounds of productsold, and was attributable mainly to expenditures necessitated to upgrade computersand computer systems to ensure that Precision Steel's order-taking and other dataprocessing systems continue to function accurately beyond December 31, 1999.
Under the skilled leadership of David Hillstrom, Precision Steel's businesses incontinued to provide an excellent return on resources employed.
Tag Ends from Savings and Loan Days
All that now remains outside Wes-FIC but within Wesco as a consequence of
Wesco's former involvement with Mutual Savings, Wesco's long-held savings andloan subsidiary, is a small real estate subsidiary, MS Property Company, that holds tagends of assets and liabilities with a net book value of about $13 million. MS Property
Company's results of operations, immaterial versus Wesco's present size, are in-
cluded in the foregoing breakdown of earnings within ""all other 'normal' netoperating income (loss).''
Of course, the main tag end from Wesco's savings and loan days is
28,800,000 shares of Freddie Mac, purchased by Mutual Savings for $72 million at atime when Freddie Mac shares could be lawfully owned only by a savings and loan

association. This holding, with a market value of $1.9 billion at yearend 1998, nowreposes in Wes-FIC.
All Other ""Normal'' Net Operating Income or Loss
All other ""normal'' net operating income or loss, net of interest paid and generalcorporate expenses, decreased to an after-tax loss of $186,000 in 1998 from an after-
tax proÑt of $1,133,000 in 1997. Sources were (1) rents ($2,921,000 gross) from
Wesco's Pasadena oCce property (leased almost entirely to outsiders, including
California Federal Bank as the ground Öoor tenant), and (2) interest and dividendsfrom cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside the insurance subsidi-
aries, less (3) costs and expenses of liquidating tag-end foreclosed real estate.
Income in 1998 was lower because (1) reversals of reserves for possible losses onsales of such tag end real estate, expensed in prior years, beneÑted earnings by about
$1.1 million in 1997, and (2) lower dividends were received in 1998 after forcedconversion of preferred stock of Citigroup Inc. (""Citigroup'') into lower-dividend-
paying common stock. The 1998 and 1997 ""other 'normal' net operating income orloss'' Ñgures also include intercompany charges for interest expense ($102,000 and
$172,000 after taxes, respectively) on borrowings from Wes-FIC. This intercompanyinterest expense does not aÅect Wesco's consolidated net income inasmuch as thesame amount is included as interest income in Wes-FIC's ""normal'' net operatingincome.
Net Securities Gains and Losses
Wesco's earnings contained securities gains of $33,609,000, after income taxes,
for 1998, versus $62,697,000, after taxes, for 1997. The entire 1998 Ñgure resultedfrom sales of marketable securities. Of the 1997 Ñgure, only $93,000 was realizedthrough the sale of securities; the balance, $62,604,000, resulted from the exchangeof the preferred and common shares of Salomon Inc (""Salomon'') owned by Wescofor preferred and common shares of The Travelers Group Inc. (""Travelers'') late inin connection with the merger of Salomon with a subsidiary of Travelers.
Accounting standards require that the fair (market) value of shares received in suchan exchange be recorded as the new cost basis as of the date of the exchange, withthe diÅerence, after appropriate reserves for future income tax on the gain, recog-
nized in the Ñnancial statements as a realized after-tax gain. For income tax purposesthe exchange is recorded at the original cost of the securities exchanged; no gain isreported on the tax return until the securities are sold.
Although the realized gains materially impacted Wesco's reported earnings foreach year, they had a very minor impact on Wesco's shareholders' equity. Inasmuch asthe greater portion of each year's realized gains had previously been reÖected in theunrealized gain component of Wesco's shareholders' equity, those amounts weremerely switched from unrealized gains to retained earnings, another component ofshareholders' equity.

Convertible Preferred Stockholdings
At the end of 1998, Wesco and its subsidiaries owned $20,000,000, at originalcost, in convertible preferred stock which by merger of Travelers and Citicorp late inbecame convertible preferred stock of Citigroup. The Travelers preferred stock,
itself, was received in 1997 (see the preceding section) in exchange for the Wescogroup's remaining shares of Salomon preferred stock, which originally cost
$20,000,000, and whose cost was adjusted upwards to $45,000,000 as of the date ofthe exchange. The issue requires redemption at par value of $20,000,000 on
October 31, 1999, if not converted to 892,105 shares of common stock before thatdate. The investment is carried on Wesco's consolidated balance sheet at fair valueof $44,000,000 as of December 31, 1998, the approximate market value of thecommon shares at that date, with the $1,000,000 diÅerence between its adjusted costand market value deducted from shareholders' equity, net of income tax eÅect,
without aÅecting reported net income, according to accounting convention. Theconvertible preferred stock was obtained at the same time Wesco's parent corpora-
tion, Berkshire Hathaway, obtained additional amounts of the same stock at the sameprice per share.
Through yearend 1997, Wesco's consolidated Ñnancial statements reÖected aninvestment in 9.25% convertible preferred stock of US Airways Group, Inc., acquiredby Wesco at par of $12,000,000 in 1989; that Ñgure was adjusted down to
$3,000,000 when we decided in 1994 that an other-than-temporary decline in thevalue of its stock had occurred. Early in 1998, US Airways called the preferred stockfor redemption. Prior to the eÅective date, Wesco converted its preferred stockinvestment to 309,718 shares of US Airways common stock and sold the latter for
$21,738,000, realizing a gain of $18,738,000 for Ñnancial statement purposes
($12,180,000 after taxes). For tax return purposes, however, only $9,738,000 of gain
($6,330,000 after taxes) will be realized, because the $9,000,000 writedown in 1994
was not deductible.
Consolidated Balance Sheet And Related Discussion
As indicated in the accompanying Ñnancial statements, Wesco's net worthincreased, as accountants compute it under their conventions, to $2.22 billion ($312
per Wesco share) at yearend 1998 from $1.76 billion ($248 per Wesco share) atyearend 1997.
The $459.5 million increase in reported net worth in 1998 was the result of threefactors: (1) $395.8 million resulting from continued net appreciation of investmentsafter provision for future taxes on capital gains; plus (2) $71.8 million from 1998 netincome; less (3) $8.1 million in dividends paid.
The foregoing $312-per-share book value approximates liquidation value assum-
ing that all Wesco's non-security assets would liquidate, after taxes, at book value.
Probably, this assumption is too conservative. But our computation of liquidationvalue is unlikely to be too low by more than two or three dollars per Wesco share,
because (1) the liquidation value of Wesco's consolidated real estate holdings

(where interesting potential now lies almost entirely in Wesco's equity in its oCceproperty in Pasadena) containing only 125,000 net rentable square feet, and
(2) unrealized appreciation in other assets (primarily Precision Steel) cannot belarge enough, in relation to Wesco's overall size, to change very much the overallcomputation of after-tax liquidating value.
Of course, so long as Wesco does not liquidate, and does not sell anyappreciated assets, it has, in eÅect, an interest-free ""loan'' from the governmentequal to its deferred income taxes on the unrealized gains, subtracted in determiningits net worth. This interest-free ""loan'' from the government is at this momentworking for Wesco shareholders and amounted to about $127 per Wesco share atyearend 1998.
However, some day, perhaps soon, major parts of the interest-free ""loan'' mustbe paid as assets are sold. Therefore, Wesco's shareholders have no perpetualadvantage creating value for them of $127 per Wesco share. Instead, the presentvalue of Wesco's shareholders' advantage must logically be much lower than $127
per Wesco share. In the writer's judgment, the value of Wesco's advantage from itstemporary, interest-free ""loan'' was probably about $30 per Wesco share at yearend
1998.
After the value of the advantage inhering in the interest-free ""loan'' is estimated,
a reasonable approximation can be made of Wesco's intrinsic value per share. Thisapproximation is made by simply adding (1) the value of the advantage from theinterest-free ""loan'' per Wesco share and (2) liquidating value per Wesco share.
Others may think diÅerently, but the foregoing approach seems reasonable to thewriter as a way of estimating intrinsic value per Wesco share.
Thus, if the value of the advantage from the interest-free tax-deferral ""loan''
present was $30 per Wesco share at yearend 1998, and after-tax liquidating valuewas then about $312 per share (Ñgures that seem rational to the writer), Wesco'sintrinsic value per share would become about $342 per share at yearend 1998, up
25% from intrinsic value as guessed in a similar calculation at the end of 1997. And,
Ñnally, this reasonable-to-this-writer, $342-per-share Ñgure for intrinsic per sharevalue of Wesco stock should be compared with the $354∂ per share price at which
Wesco stock was selling on December 31, 1998. This comparison indicates that
Wesco stock was then selling about 4% above intrinsic value.
As Wesco's unrealized appreciation has continued to grow in frothy markets forsecurities, it should be remembered that it is subject to market Öuctuation, possiblydramatic on the downside, with no guaranty as to its ultimate full realization.
Unrealized after-tax appreciation represents 76% of Wesco's shareholders' equity atyearend), versus 73% and 70% one and two years earlier.
Business and human quality in place at Wesco continues to be not nearly asgood, all factors considered, as that in place at Berkshire Hathaway. Wesco is not anequally-good-but-smaller version of Berkshire Hathaway, better because its smallsize makes growth easier. Instead, each dollar of book value at Wesco continues

plainly to provide much less intrinsic value than a similar dollar of book value at
Berkshire Hathaway. Moreover, the quality disparity in book value's intrinsic meritshas, in recent years, been widening in favor of Berkshire Hathaway.
All that said, we make no attempt to appraise relative attractiveness for invest-
ment of Wesco versus Berkshire Hathaway stock at present stock-market quotations.
We are not now pessimists, on a long-term basis, about business expansion.
Despite present super-ebullient markets for entire businesses, making it hard for
Wesco to Ñnd attractive opportunities, we do not believe that such opportunities willnever come.
On January 13, 1999 Wesco increased its regular dividend from 28¥ cents pershare to 29¥ cents per share, payable March 10, 1999, to shareholders of record asof the close of business on February 10, 1999.
This annual report contains Form 10-K, a report Ñled with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, and includes detailed information about Wesco and itssubsidiaries as well as audited Ñnancial statements bearing extensive footnotes. Asusual, your careful attention is sought with respect to these items.
