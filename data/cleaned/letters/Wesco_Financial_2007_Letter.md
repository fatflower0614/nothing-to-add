Insurance Businesses
Consolidated operating earnings from insurance businesses represent the combina-
tion of the results of their insurance underwriting (premiums earned, less insurance losses,
loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses) with their investment income.
Following is a summary of these figures as they pertain to all insurance operations (in 000s).

As shown above, operating income includes significant net investment income,
representing dividends and interest earned from marketable securities. However, operatingincome excludes investment gains of $15.8 million, net of income taxes, realized in 2007.

No investment gains or losses were realized in 2006. The discussion below will concen-
trate on insurance underwriting, not on the results from investments.
Wes-FIC engages in the reinsurance business. For the past several years, its reinsur-
ance activity has consisted of the participation in several risk pools managed by aninsurance subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, our 80%-owning parent. The arrangementbecame effective in 2001 and most recently covered hull, liability and workers’ compen-
sation exposures relating to the aviation industry, as follows: for 2006, to the extent of
121⁄2% of the hull and liability pools and 5% of the workers’ compensation pool; for 2007,16.67% of the hull and liability pools and 5% of the workers’ compensation pool. Theparticipation rates remain unchanged for 2008. The Berkshire subsidiary provides a portionof the upper-level reinsurance protection to these aviation risk pools on terms that couldresult in the Berkshire subsidiary having a different interest from that of Wes-FIC undercertain conditions, e.g., in settling a large loss.
Wesco’s Board of Directors has recently and enthusiastically approved Wes-FIC’s mostsignificant reinsurance contract to date: its participation, since January 1, 2008, in anagreement with National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), another Berkshire Hathawayinsurance subsidiary, for the assumption of 10% of NICO’s quota-share reinsurance of
Swiss Reinsurance Company and its property-casualty affiliates (“Swiss Re”). Under thisretrocession agreement, Wes-FIC will effectively assume 2% of all of Swiss Re’s property-
casualty risks incepting over the next five years on the same terms as NICO’s agreementwith Swiss Re. If recent years’volumes were to continue over the next five years, the annualwritten premiums assumed by Wes-FIC under this retrocession agreement would be in the
$300 million range; however, actual premiums assumed over the five-year period couldvary significantly depending on market conditions and opportunities.
It is the nature of even the finest casualty insurance businesses that in keeping theiraccounts they must estimate and deduct all future costs and losses from premiums alreadyearned. Uncertainties inherent in this undertaking make financial statements more mere
“best honest guesses” than is typically the case with accounts of non-insurance-writingcorporations. The reinsurance portion of the casualty insurance business, because itcontains one or more extra links in the loss-reporting chain, usually creates more account-
ing uncertainty than in the non-reinsurance portion. Wesco shareholders should remainaware of the inherent imperfections of Wes-FIC’s accounting, based as it is on forecasts ofoutcomes in many future years.
Wes-FIC’s underwriting results have typically fluctuated from year to year, but havebeen satisfactory. When stated as a percentage, the sum of insurance losses, loss adjust-
ment expenses and underwriting expenses, divided by premiums, gives the combinedratio. The combined ratios of Wes-FIC have been much better than average for insurers.
Wes-FIC’s combined ratios were 93.9% for 2007 and 94.0% for 2006. We try to createsome underwriting gain as results are averaged out over many years. We expect this tobecome increasingly difficult.
Float is the term for money we hold temporarily, and as long as our insuranceunderwriting results are break-even or better, it costs us nothing. We expect that the newbusiness venture with NICO will significantly increase Wes-FIC’s float from its yearend 2007
balance of $94 million, thus providing additional opportunities for investment.
Kansas Bankers was purchased by Wes-FIC in 1996 for approximately $80 million incash. Its tangible net worth now exceeds its acquisition price, and it has been a very

satisfactory acquisition, reflecting the sound management of President Don Towle and histeam.
Kansas Bankers was chartered in 1909 to underwrite deposit insurance for Kansasbanks. Its offices are in Topeka, Kansas. Over the years its service has continued to adapt tothe changing needs of the banking industry. Today its customer base, consisting mostly ofsmall- and medium-sized community banks, is spread throughout 38 mainly midwesternstates. In addition to bank deposit guaranty bonds which insure deposits in excess of FDIC
coverage, KBS offers directors and officers indemnity policies, bank employment practicespolicies, bank insurance agents professional errors and omissions indemnity policies and
Internet banking catastrophe theft insurance.
When Wesco purchased KBS, it had been ceding almost half of its premium volume toreinsurers. Now it reinsures only about 15%. Effective in 2006, insurance subsidiaries of
Berkshire Hathaway became KBS’s sole reinsurers. Previously, an unaffiliated reinsurer wasalso involved. The increased volume of business retained comes, of course, with increasedirregularity in the income stream. KBS’s combined ratios were 55.1% for 2007 and 73.8%
for 2006. We continue to expect volatile but favorable long-term results from KBS.
CORT Business Services Corporation (“CORT”)
In February 2000, Wesco purchased CORT Business Services Corporation (“CORT”)
for $386 million in cash.
CORT is a very long-established company that is the country’s leader in rentals offurniture that lessees have no intention of buying. In the trade, people call CORT’s activity
“rent-to-rent” to distinguish it from “lease-to-purchase” businesses that are, in essence,
installment sellers of furniture.
However, just as Enterprise, as a rent-to-rent auto lessor in short-term arrangements,
must be skilled in selling used cars, CORT must be and is skilled in selling used furniture.
CORT’s revenues totaled $396 million for calendar 2007, versus $400 million forcalendar 2006. Of these amounts, furniture rental revenues were $327 million and
$324 million, furniture sales revenues were $62 million and $70 million, and rentalrelocation revenues were $7 million and $6 million. CORT operated at after-tax profits of
$20.3 million for 2007 and $26.9 million for 2006.
When we purchased CORT early in 2000, its furniture rental business was rapidlygrowing, reflecting the strong U.S. economy, phenomenal business expansion and explo-
sive growth of IPOs and the high-tech sector.
Beginning late in 2000, however, new business coming into CORT began to decline.
With the burst of the dot-com bubble, the events of September 11, and a protractedslowdown in new business formation, CORT’s operations were hammered, reflectinggenerally bad results in the “rent-to-rent” segment of the furniture rental business. Obvi-
ously, when we purchased CORT we were poor predictors of near-term industry-wideprospects of the “rent-to-rent” sector of the furniture business.
CORT started up a new service in 2001. Originally a subsidiary named Relocation
Central, and subsequently integrated into CORT’s operations, CORT’s rental relocationactivities were intended mainly to supplement its furniture rental business by providingapartment locator and ancillary services to relocating individuals. Long CORT’s star CEO,
Paul Arnold is in process of expanding CORT’s rental relocation services and redirecting its

marketing toward the needs of businesses and governmental agencies who require a skilledand able partner to provide comprehensive and seamless relocation services for thetemporary relocation of employees, worldwide. With several websites, principallywww.cort.com, www.relocationcentral.com and www.apartmentsearch.com, profession-
als in more than 80 domestic metropolitan markets, affiliates in more than 50 countries,
almost twenty thousand apartment communities referring their tenants to CORT, manyancillary services, and its entrée to the business community as a Berkshire Hathawaycompany, CORT’s rental relocation operations may now be moving in the right direction.
In January 2008, CORT expanded its operations to the United Kingdom through thepurchase of Roomservice Group, a small regional provider of furniture rental and relo-
cation services.
CORT’s operations are subject to economic cycles. We are pleased with CORT’sprogress in the past few years; however, we believe that it will likely suffer its share of thedownturn as we enter a period of economic contraction. CORTis now a stronger companythan it was when acquired by Wesco, helped by several “tuck-in” acquisitions, and poisedtowards long-term growth despite periodic bumps to be encountered along the way.
More details with respect to CORT are contained throughout this annual report, towhich your careful attention is directed.
Precision Steel Warehouse, Inc. (“Precision Steel”)
The businesses of Wesco’s Precision Steel subsidiary, headquartered in the outskirts of
Chicago at Franklin Park, Illinois, operated at after-tax profits of $0.9 million in 2007 and
$1.2 million in 2006. These figures reflect after-tax LIFO inventory accounting adjustmentsdecreasing after-tax income by $1.0 million for 2007 and $0.6 million for 2006. Precision
Steel’s operating results for 2006 also reflect expenses, net of insurance recoveries, of
$0.3 million, after taxes, in connection with environmental cleanup of an industrial parkwhere a Precision Steel subsidiary has operated alongside approximately 15 other man-
ufacturers for many years. Had it not been for the LIFO accounting adjustments, or theenvironmental matter discussed in Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financialstatements, Precision Steel would have reported after-tax operating income of $1.9 millionfor 2007 and $2.1 million for 2006.
Precision Steel’s business has been subject to economic cycles. Although the fiercelycompetitive, chaotic pressures which affected its steel service center business several yearsago have abated, Precision Steel is continuing to suffer the ongoing effects of a long-termreduction in demand caused by customers’ (or former customers’) unsuccessful compe-
tition with manufacturers outside the United States. Precision Steel’s revenues decreased
2.7% in 2007, following an increase of 2.8% in 2006, approximately half of which was dueto an extraordinary order of shimstock and other industrial supplies from a customer of its
Precision Brand Products subsidiary. In 2007, Precision Steel’s service center volume wasmillion pounds, down from 46 million pounds in 2006 and 69 million pounds sold asrecently as 1999. This decline in physical volume is a serious reverse, not likely todisappear in some “bounce back” effect. Nor do we expect that ongoing price increaseslike the approximately 66% rise that has occurred since 1999, holding dollar volumeroughly level despite a precipitous drop in physical volume, will continue.
Although Precision Steel’s recent after-tax operating earnings of approximately $1 mil-
lion per year may signal improvement when compared with its after-tax operating loss of

$0.9 million for 2003, we do not consider present operating results to be a satisfactoryinvestment outcome. Recent earnings of Precision Steel compare unfavorably with oper-
ating earnings which averaged $2.3 million, after taxes, for the years 1998 through 2000.
Because the steel warehouse business may revert to even more difficult conditions, moredecline for Precision Steel may lie ahead.
Terry Piper, who became Precision Steel’s President and Chief Executive Officer in
1999, has done an outstanding job in leading Precision Steel through very difficult years.
But he has no magic wand with which to compensate for competitive losses among his bestcustomers.
Tag Ends from Savings and Loan Days
All that now remains outside Wes-FIC but within Wesco as a consequence of Wesco’sformer involvement with Mutual Savings, Wesco’s long-held savings and loan subsidiary, isa small real estate subsidiary, MS Property Company, that holds tag ends of appreciated realestate assets consisting mainly of the nine-story commercial office building in downtown
Pasadena, where Wesco is headquartered. Adjacent to that building is a parcel of land onwhich our construction of a multi-story luxury condominium building is nearing com-
pletion. We are also seeking city approval of our plans to build another multi-story luxurycondominium building, at a later date, on a vacant parcel of land in the next block. Formore information, if you want a very-high-end condominium, simply phone Bob Sahm
(626-585-6700). MS Property Company’s results of operations, immaterial versus Wesco’spresent size, are included in the breakdown of earnings on page 1 within “other operatingearnings.”
Other Operating Earnings (Loss)
Other operating earnings (loss), net of interest paid and general corporate expenses,
amounted to ($0.1 million) in 2007, versus $0.2 million in 2006. The components of the
$0.1 million of other operating loss in 2007 were (1) rents ($3.9 million gross in 2007) prin-
cipally from Wesco’s Pasadena office property (leased almost entirely to outsiders, includ-
ing Citibank as the ground floor tenant), and (2) interest and dividends from cashequivalents and marketable securities held outside the insurance subsidiaries, less (3) gen-
eral corporate expenses plus minor expenses involving tag-end real estate.
Consolidated Balance Sheet and Related Discussion
Wesco carries its investments at fair value, with unrealized appreciation, after incometax effect, included as a separate component of shareholders’ equity, and related deferredtaxes included in income taxes payable, on its consolidated balance sheet. As indicated inthe accompanying financial statements, Wesco’s net worth, as accountants compute itunder their conventions, increased to $2.53 billion ($356 per Wesco share) at yearendfrom $2.40 billion ($337 per Wesco share) at yearend 2006. The main causes of theincrease were net operating income after deduction of dividends paid to shareholders, andappreciation in fair value of investments.
The foregoing $356-per-share book value approximates liquidation value assumingthat all Wesco’s non-security assets would liquidate, after taxes, at book value.
Of course, so long as Wesco does not liquidate, and does not sell any appreciatedsecurities, it has, in effect, an interest-free “loan” from the government equal to its

deferred income taxes of $322 million, subtracted in determining its net worth. Thisinterest-free “loan” from the government is at this moment working for Wesco shareholdersand amounted to about $45 per Wesco share at yearend 2007.
However, some day, parts of the interest-free “loan” may be removed as securities aresold. Therefore, Wesco’s shareholders have no perpetual advantage creating value for themof $45 per Wesco share. Instead, the present value of Wesco’s shareholders’ advantagemust logically be much lower than $45 per Wesco share.
Business and human quality in place at Wesco continues to be not nearly as good, allfactors considered, as that in place at Berkshire Hathaway. Wesco is not an equally-good-
but-smaller version of Berkshire Hathaway, better because its small size makes growtheasier. Instead, each dollar of book value at Wesco continues plainly to provide much lessintrinsic value than a similar dollar of book value at Berkshire Hathaway. Moreover, thequality disparity in book value’s intrinsic merits has, in recent years, continued to widen infavor of Berkshire Hathaway.
All that said, we make no attempt to appraise relative attractiveness for investment of
Wesco versus Berkshire Hathaway stock at present stock-market quotations.
Last year we reported that Wesco had held more than $1 billion of cash equivalentsand fixed-maturity investments since early in 2003. In the latter part of 2007 Wescoinvested $802 million, net, in marketable equity securities. Of its $3.1 billion of assets at
December 31, 2007, $565 million is invested in cash equivalents and fixed-maturityinvestments. Unless significant additional amounts can be attractively reinvested inacquisitions, equity securities or other long-term instruments of the type that helped causethe long-term growth of Wesco’s shareholders’ equity, future returns on shareholders’
equity will probably be less than those of the past. Due to the current size of Wesco and itsparent, Berkshire Hathaway, Wesco’s opportunities for growing shareholders’ equity areunlikely to be as attractive as in the past.
The Board of Directors recently increased Wesco’s regular dividend from 371⁄2 centsper share to 381⁄2 cents per share, payable March 6, 2008, to shareholders of record as of theclose of business on February 7, 2008.
This annual report contains Form 10-K, a report filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, and includes detailed information about Wesco and its subsidiaries as well asaudited financial statements bearing extensive footnotes. As usual, your careful attention issought with respect to these items.
Shareholders can access much Wesco information, including printed annual reports,
earnings releases, SEC filings, and the websites of Wesco’s subsidiaries and parent,
Berkshire Hathaway, from Wesco’s website: www.wescofinancial.com.
