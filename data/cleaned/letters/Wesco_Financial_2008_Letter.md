Insurance Businesses
Consolidated operating earnings from insurance businesses represent the combina-
tion of the results of their insurance underwriting (premiums earned, less insurance losses,
loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses) with their investment income.
Following is a summary of these figures as they pertain to all insurance operations (in 000s).

As shown above, operating income includes significant net investment income,
representing dividends and interest earned from marketable securities. However, operatingincome excludes after-tax investment gains of $4.6 million realized in 2008 and
$15.8 million, in 2007. The discussion below will concentrate on insurance underwriting,
not on the results from investments.
Wes-FIC engages in the reinsurance business. For several years, through yearend
2007, Wes-FIC’s principal reinsurance activity consisted of only the participation in severalpools managed by an insurance subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, Wesco’s 80%-owning

parent. The arrangement became effective in 2001 and has covered hull, liability andworkers’ compensation exposures relating to the aviation industry, as follows: for 2006, tothe extent of 121⁄2% of the hull and liability pools and 5% of the workers’ compensationpool; and, since 2007, 16.67% of the hull and liability pools and 5% of the workers’
compensation pool. The Berkshire subsidiary provides a portion of the upper-level rein-
surance protection to these aviation risk pools on terms that could result in the Berkshiresubsidiary having a different interest from that of Wes-FIC under certain conditions, e.g., insettling a large loss.
At the beginning of 2008, Wes-FIC entered into a retrocession agreement with
National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), another Berkshire Hathaway insurance subsid-
iary, for the assumption of 10% of NICO’s 20% quota-share reinsurance of Swiss Rein-
surance Company and its principal property-casualty affiliates (“Swiss Re”). Under thisagreement, which was enthusiastically approved by Wesco’s Board of Directors, Wes-FIC
has assumed 2% of essentially all Swiss Re property-casualty risks incepting over the five-
year period which began on January 1, 2008, on the same terms as NICO’s agreement with
Swiss Re. Wes-FIC’s share of written and earned premiums under the contract for 2008
were $265.2 million and $183.2 million, representing a very significant increase in Wes-
FIC’s reinsurance activities to date. It is important to keep in mind that premiums assumedunder the contract in each of the next four years could vary significantly depending onmarket conditions and opportunities.
It is the nature of even the finest property-casualty insurance businesses that inkeeping their accounts they must estimate and deduct all future costs and losses frompremiums already earned. Uncertainties inherent in this undertaking make financialstatements more mere “best honest guesses” than is typically the case with accounts ofnon-insurance-writing corporations. And the reinsurance portion of the property-casualtyinsurance business, because it contains one or more extra links in the loss-reporting chain,
usually creates more accounting uncertainty than in the non-reinsurance portion. Wescoshareholders should remain aware of the inherent imperfections of Wes-FIC’s accounting,
based as it is on forecasts of outcomes in many future years.
Wes-FIC’s underwriting results have typically fluctuated from year to year, but havebeen satisfactory. When stated as a percentage, the sum of insurance losses, loss adjust-
ment expenses and underwriting expenses, divided by premiums, gives the combinedratio. The combined ratios of Wes-FIC have been much better than average for insurers.
Wes-FIC’s combined ratios were 101.0% for 2008, 93.9% for 2007 and 94.0% for 2006.
We try to create some underwriting gain as results are averaged out over many years. Weexpect this to become increasingly difficult.
Float is the term for money we hold temporarily, and, as long as our insuranceunderwriting results are break-even or better, it costs us nothing. We expect that the newbusiness venture with NICO will significantly increase Wes-FIC’s float, from its yearendbalance of $164 million, thus providing additional opportunities for investment.
Kansas Bankers was purchased by Wes-FIC in 1996 for approximately $80 million incash. Its tangible net worth now exceeds its acquisition price, and it has been a verysatisfactory acquisition, reflecting the sound management of President Don Towle and histeam.

Kansas Bankers was chartered in 1909 to underwrite deposit insurance for Kansasbanks. Its offices are in Topeka, Kansas. Over the years its service has continued to adapt tothe changing needs of the banking industry. Today its customer base, consisting mostly ofsmall- and medium-sized community banks, is spread throughout 39 mainly Midwesternstates. Kansas Bankers offers policies for crime insurance, check kiting fraud indemnifi-
cation, Internet banking catastrophe theft insurance, Internet banking privacy liabilityinsurance, directors and officers liability, bank employment practices, and bank insuranceagents professional errors and omissions indemnity.
Because of recent events in the banking industry, including a number of bank failures,
we are less confident in the long-term profitability of Kansas Bankers’ long-established lineof deposit guarantee bonds than previously. These bonds insure specific customer bankdeposits above Federal insurance limits. After sustaining a loss of $4.7 million, after taxes,
from a bank failure in the latter half of 2008, Kansas Bankers discontinued writing depositguarantee bonds, and in September 2008 it began to exit this line of insurance as rapidly asfeasible. The aggregate face amount of outstanding deposit guarantee bonds has beenreduced, from $9.7 billion, insuring 1,671 institutions at September 30, 2008, to
$3.4 billion, insuring 796 institutions at February 15, 2009, the first date that non-renewalsand non-voluntary cancellations became effective. It is believed that few of the institutions
Kansas Bankers insures are facing significant risk of failure. Because of aggregate limits aswell as the purchase of reinsurance, the after-tax risk to Wesco from the failure of any singlebank insured by Kansas Bankers is limited to a maximum of $7.6 million. Thus, we believethat Wesco’s shareholders’ equity is not significantly at risk as Kansas Bankers rapidly exitsthis line of insurance.
This decrease in exposure to loss, of course, will cause a sharp decline in Kansas
Bankers’ insurance volume, inasmuch as premiums from guarantee bonds not onlyapproximated half of Kansas Bankers’ written premiums for 2008, but also representedthe entirety of the business it has recently conducted in 16 of the 39 states in which it islicensed to write insurance.
When Wesco purchased Kansas Bankers, it had been ceding almost half of itspremium volume to reinsurers. In 2008 it reinsured only about 14%. And, because ithas also restructured the layers of losses reinsured, it is now better protected from thedownside risk of large losses. Effective in 2006, insurance subsidiaries of Berkshire
Hathaway became KBS’s sole reinsurers. Previously, an unaffiliated reinsurer was alsoinvolved. The increased volume of business retained comes, of course, with increasedirregularity in the income stream. Kansas Bankers’ combined ratios were 111.6% for 2008,55.1% for 2007 and 73.8% for 2006. We continue to expect volatile but favorable long-
term results from Kansas Bankers.
CORT Business Services Corporation (“CORT”)
In February 2000, Wesco purchased CORT Business Services Corporation (“CORT”)
for $386 million in cash.
CORTis a very long-established company that is the country’s leader in rentals of high-
quality furniture that lessees have no intention of buying. In the trade, people call CORT’sactivity “rent-to-rent” to distinguish it from “lease-to-purchase” businesses that are, inessence, installment sellers of furniture.

However, just as Enterprise, as a rent-to-rent auto lessor in short-term arrangements,
must be skilled in selling used cars, CORT must be and is skilled in selling used furniture.
CORT’s revenues totaled $410 million for calendar 2008, versus $396 million forcalendar 2007. Of these amounts, furniture rental revenues were $340 million and
$327 million, furniture sales revenues were $62 million each year, and rental relocationrevenues were $8 million and $7 million. CORT operated at after-tax profits of $15.7 mil-
lion for 2008 and $20.3 million for 2007.
Since its acquisition, CORThas made several “tuck-in” acquisitions, most recently, theresidential furniture rental division of Aaron Rents, Inc., and earlier in 2008, the estab-
lishment of international operations through the purchase of Roomservice Group, a smallregional provider of rental furniture and relocation services in the United Kingdom, nowdoing business as CORT Business Services UK Ltd. CORT has also started up a nation-wideapartment locator service, originally intended mainly to supplement CORT’s furniturerental business by providing apartment locator and ancillary services to relocating indi-
viduals. Paul Arnold, long CORT’s star CEO, and his management team, have devotedmuch effort over the past two years, expanding and redirecting CORT’s rental relocationservices toward the needs of businesses and government agencies who require a skilledand able partner to provide comprehensive and seamless relocation services for thetemporary relocation of employees worldwide.
CORT’s operating results are subject to economic cycles. When we purchased CORT,
its furniture rental business was rapidly growing, reflecting the strong U.S. economy,
phenomenal business expansion and explosive growth of IPOs and the high-tech sector.
Shortly thereafter, with the burst of the dot-com bubble, followed by the events of
September 11 and a protracted slowdown in new business formation, CORT’s operationswere hammered, reflecting generally bad results in the “rent-to-rent” segment of thefurniture rental business. There followed a far-too-short period of improving businessconditions which have more recently given way to increasingly difficult recessionaryconditions, perhaps the beginning of the worst economic recession in decades.
Under Wesco’s ownership, CORT has continuously undertaken to improve its com-
petitive position. With several websites, principally, www.cort.com and www.apartment-
search.com, professionals in more than 80 domestic metropolitan markets, affiliatesservicing more than 50 countries, almost twenty thousand apartment communities refer-
ring their tenants to CORT, many ancillary services, and its entrée to the business com-
munity as a Berkshire Hathaway company, CORT is better positioned than previously tobenefit from an economic turnaround, certain to occur in due course. Near term, weexpect more of the difficult business conditions of the recent past.
More details with respect to CORT are contained throughout this annual report, towhich your careful attention is directed.
Precision Steel Warehouse, Inc. (“Precision Steel”)
The businesses of Wesco’s Precision Steel subsidiary, headquartered in the outskirts of
Chicago at Franklin Park, Illinois, operated at after-tax profits of $0.8 million in 2008 and
$0.9 million in 2007. These figures reflect after-tax LIFO inventory accounting adjustmentsdecreasing after-tax income by $0.7 million for 2008 and $1.0 million for 2007. Precision
Steel’s operating results for 2008 also reflect the benefit of $0.2 million, after taxes, from thereversal of a portion of a provision for estimated expenses recorded in prior years in

connection with the environmental cleanup of an industrial park where a Precision Steelsubsidiary has operated alongside approximately 15 other manufacturers for many years.
Had it not been for the LIFO accounting adjustments or the benefit from the reversal ofthose environmental-related expenses, Precision Steel would have reported after-taxoperating income of $1.3 million for 2008 and $1.9 million for 2007.
Precision Steel is continuing to suffer not only the ongoing effects of a long-termreduction in demand caused by customers’ (or former customers’) unsuccessful compe-
tition with manufacturers outside the United States and a trend towards smaller-sizedorders, but also, the difficult effects from deepening recessionary conditions. In 2008,
Precision Steel’s service center volume was 37 million pounds, down from 39 millionpounds in 2007 and 69 million pounds sold as recently as 1999. Volume for the fourthquarter of 2008 was only 6.2 million pounds, down 34% from the corresponding 2007
figure. Apart from the recessionary-caused weakness, the general and ongoing decline in
Precision Steel’s physical volume is a serious reverse, not likely to disappear in some
“bounce back” effect once the economy recovers. Nor do we expect that ongoing priceincreases like the approximately 111% rise that has occurred since 1999, holding dollarvolume roughly level despite a precipitous drop in physical volume, will continue.
We do not consider Precision Steel’s recent after-tax operating earnings of approx-
imately $1 million annually to be a satisfactory investment outcome, particularly whencompared with its after-tax operating earnings which averaged $2.3 million for the yearsthrough 2000. And, because of the intensifying recession, more difficulty for Pre-
cision Steel will surely lie ahead.
Terry Piper, who became Precision Steel’s President and Chief Executive Officer in
1999, has done an outstanding job in leading Precision Steel through very difficult years.
But he has no magic wand with which to compensate for competitive losses among his bestcustomers or from the deepening recession. He is undertaking the difficult task of paringcosts to an endurable level.
Tag Ends from Savings and Loan Days
All that now remains outside Wes-FIC but within Wesco as a consequence of Wesco’sformer involvement with Mutual Savings, Wesco’s long-held savings and loan subsidiary, isa small real estate subsidiary, MS Property Company, that holds tag ends of appreciated realestate assets consisting mainly of the nine-story commercial office building in downtown
Pasadena, where Wesco is headquartered. Adjacent to that building is a parcel of land onwhich our construction of a multi-story luxury condominium building is almost complete.
We are also seeking city approval of our plans to build another multi-story luxurycondominium building, at a later date, on a vacant parcel of land in the next block.
For more information, if you want a very-high-end condominium, simply phone Bob Sahm
(626-585-6700). MS Property Company’s results of operations, immaterial versus Wesco’spresent size, are included in the breakdown of earnings on page 1 within “other operatingearnings.”
Other Operating Earnings (Loss)
Other operating earnings (loss), net of interest paid and general corporate expenses,
amounted to ($0.4 million) in 2008, versus ($0.1) million in 2007. The components of the
$0.4 million of other operating loss in 2008 were (1) rents ($4.0 million gross in 2008) prin-
cipally from Wesco’s Pasadena office property (leased almost entirely to outsiders,

including Citibank as the ground floor tenant), and (2) interest and dividends from cashequivalents and marketable securities held outside the insurance subsidiaries, less (3) gen-
eral corporate expenses plus expenses involving tag-end real estate.
Consolidated Balance Sheet and Related Discussion
Strategically, we strive to invest in businesses that possess excellent economics, withable and honest management, at sensible prices. We prefer to invest a meaningful amountin each investee, resulting in concentration, exposing the portfolio to more significantmarket price fluctuations than might be the case were Wesco’s investments more diver-
sified. Concentration has worked out very well in the past as evidenced by significantrealized investment gains. Details as to Wesco’s investments can be found in Note 2 to theaccompanying consolidated financial statements. Most equity investments are expected tobe held for long periods of time; thus, we are not ordinarily troubled by short-term pricevolatility with respect to our investments provided that the underlying business, economicand management characteristics of the investees remain favorable. We strive to maintainmuch liquidity to provide a margin of safety against short-term equity price volatility.
Since the latter part of 2007, Wesco has invested $1.1 billion, at cost, in marketableequity securities, bringing the aggregate cost of Wesco’s equity investments to $1.63 billionat yearend 2008, including an aggregate of $650 million, at cost, invested in the commonstocks of Wells Fargo & Company and US Bancorp. The timing of our recent investmentscould not have been much worse. During 2008, several crises affecting the financialsystem and capital markets of the U.S. resulted in very large price declines in the generalstock market, and in the banking sector, in particular, due significantly to the ongoingliquidity crisis as well as the deterioration of asset quality and earnings reported by thebanking industry.
Wesco carries its investments at fair value, with unrealized appreciation or depreci-
ation, after income tax effect, included as a component of shareholders’ equity, and relateddeferred taxes included in income taxes payable, on its consolidated balance sheet. Asindicated in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, Wesco’s net worth, asaccountants compute it under their conventions, decreased to $2.38 billion ($334 per
Wesco share) at yearend 2008 from $2.53 billion ($356 per Wesco share) one year earlier.
The principal cause of the decrease was the after-tax decline in fair value of Wesco’sinvestments in marketable equity securities. As a result of further declines in fair values ofthese investments subsequent to yearend 2008, Wesco’s shareholders’ equity has furtherdeclined, by $303 million ($43 per share), through February 24, 2009.
The worldwide economy is currently suffering the effects of a deepening recession,
perhaps the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression. We will not attempt toprognosticate the effects that Wesco will suffer or when the economy will recover, but weare certain that in due course, Wesco will prosper. In the mean time, Wesco’s operationswill bear their share of economic woes. We will continue to practice Ben Franklin’s advice,
that “a penny saved is a penny earned,” as we trim expenses, albeit in higher denomi-
nations, to better endure the weakening economic conditions that surely lie ahead.
Business and human quality in place at Wesco continues to be not nearly as good, allfactors considered, as that in place at Berkshire Hathaway. Wesco is not an equally-good-
but-smaller version of Berkshire Hathaway, better because its small size makes growtheasier. Instead, each dollar of book value at Wesco continues plainly to provide much lessintrinsic value than a similar dollar of book value at Berkshire Hathaway. Moreover, the

quality disparity in book value’s intrinsic merits has, in recent years, continued to widen infavor of Berkshire Hathaway.
All that said, we make no attempt to appraise relative attractiveness for investment of
Wesco versus Berkshire Hathaway stock at present stock-market quotations.
The Board of Directors recently increased Wesco’s regular dividend from 381⁄2 centsper share to 391⁄2 cents per share, payable March 5, 2009, to shareholders of record as of theclose of business on February 5, 2009.
This annual report contains Form 10-K, a report filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, and includes detailed information about Wesco and its subsidiaries as well asaudited financial statements bearing extensive footnotes. As usual, your careful attention issought with respect to these items.
Shareholders can access much Wesco information, including printed annual reports,
earnings releases, SEC filings, and the websites of Wesco’s subsidiaries and parent,
Berkshire Hathaway, from Wesco’s website: www.wescofinancial.com.
