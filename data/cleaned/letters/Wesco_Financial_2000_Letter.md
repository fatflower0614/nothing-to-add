Wesco-Financial Insurance Company (""Wes-FIC'')
Consolidated operating earnings of Wes-FIC and KBS represent the combinationof the results of their insurance underwriting with their net investment income.
Following is a summary of these Ñgures as they pertain to Wes-FIC, excluding itssubsidiary, KBS. The operating earnings of Wes-FIC's KBS subsidiary are discussed inthe section, ""The Kansas Bankers Surety Company,'' below.

As shown above, Wes-FIC's consolidated operating earnings include signiÑcantnet investment income, representing dividends and interest earned on its portfolio ofmarketable securities. Wes-FIC's consolidated operating earnings exclude its realizednet securities gains, net of income taxes, of $853.1 million in 2000 versus $7.3 millionin 1999. Our discussion will concentrate on Wes-FIC's insurance underwriting, noton the results of its investments.
At the end of 2000 Wes-FIC retained about $19 million in invested assets, oÅsetby claims reserves, from its former reinsurance arrangement with Fireman's Fund
Group. This arrangement was terminated August 31, 1989. However, it will take along time before all claims are settled, and, meanwhile, Wes-FIC is being helpedover many years by proceeds from investing ""Öoat'' and by favorable loss develop-
ment, which has enabled it to reduce the liability for losses and loss-relatedexpenses, beneÑting after-tax operating earnings by $.8 million in 2000 and $1.7 mil-
lion in 1999.
Wes-FIC engages in other reinsurance business, including large and small quotashare arrangements similar and dissimilar to our previous reinsurance contract with
Fireman's Fund Group, and, from time to time, in super-cat reinsurance, described ingreat detail in our pre-1999 annual reports, which Wesco shareholders should re-
read each year. Although Wes-FIC was not active in super-cat reinsurance businessin 2000, its operating earnings beneÑted by $.9 million, after taxes, in 1999. Onsuper-cat reinsurance accepted by Wes-FIC to date (March 5, 2001) there has beenno loss whatsoever that we know of, but some ""no-claims'' contingent commissionshave been paid to original cessors of business (i.e., cessors not including Berkshire
Hathaway).
The balance of Wes-FIC's after-tax underwriting proÑt or loss not describedabove, amounted to underwriting loss of $1.2 million for 2000 and underwritingproÑt of $.2 million for 1999.
In all recent reinsurance sold by us, other subsidiaries of our 80%-owning parent,
Berkshire Hathaway, sold several times as much reinsurance to the same customerson the same terms. In certain instances, such subsidiaries have taken from us a 3%-

of-premiums ceding commission on premium volume passed through them to Wes-
FIC. Excepting this ceding commission, Wes-FIC has had virtually no insurance-
acquisition or insurance administration costs with regard to those policies.
Wes-FIC remains a very strong insurance company, with very low costs, and,
one way or another, in the future as in the past, we expect to continue to Ñnd andseize at least a few sensible insurance opportunities.
Wesco shareholders should continue to realize that recent marvelous underwrit-
ing results are sure to be followed, sometime, by one or more horrible underwritinglosses from super-cat or other insurance written by Wes-FIC.
The Kansas Bankers Surety Company (""KBS'')
KBS, purchased by Wes-FIC in 1996 for approximately $80 million in cash,
contributed $7 million to the consolidated operating earnings of the insurancebusinesses in 2000 and $7.2 million in 1999. These Ñgures are before goodwillamortization under accounting convention of $.8 million each year. The results of
KBS have been combined with those of Wes-FIC, and are included in the table onpage 1 in the category, ""operating earnings of Wes-FIC and KBS insurancebusinesses.''
KBS was chartered in 1909 to underwrite deposit insurance for Kansas banks. ItsoCces are in Topeka, Kansas. Over the years its service has continued to adapt to thechanging needs of the banking industry. Today its customer base, consisting mostlyof small and medium-sized community banks, is spread throughout 25 mainlymidwestern states. In addition to bank deposit guaranty bonds which insure depositsin excess of FDIC coverage, KBS also oÅers directors and oCcers indemnity policies,
bank employment practices policies, bank annuity and mutual funds indemnitypolicies and bank insurance agents professional errors and omissions indemnitypolicies.
KBS increased the volume of business retained eÅective in 1998. It hadpreviously ceded almost half of its premium volume to reinsurers; and, it nowreinsures only about 5% under arrangements whereby other Berkshire subsidiariestake 50% and unrelated reinsurers take the other 50%. As we indicated last year, theincreased volume of business retained comes, of course, with increased irregularityin the income stream.
KBS's combined ratio remained much better than average for insurers, at 73.9%
for 2000 and 59.4% for 1999, versus 37.2% for 1997, and we continue to expectvolatile but favorable long-term eÅects from increased insurance retained.
KBS is run by Donald Towle, President, assisted by 15 dedicated oCcers andemployees.

CORT Business Services Corporation (""CORT'')
In February 2000, Wesco purchased CORT Business Services Corporation
(""CORT'') for $386 million in cash. In addition, CORT retains about $45 million ofpreviously existing debt.
CORT is a very long established company that is the country's leader in rentalsof furniture that lessees have no intention of buying. In the trade, people call CORT'sactivity ""rent-to-rent'' to distinguish it from ""lease-to-purchase'' businesses that are,
in essence, installment sellers of furniture.
However, just as Hertz, as a rent-to-rent auto lessor in short-term arrangements,
must be skilled in selling used cars, CORT must be and is skilled in selling usedfurniture.
In the ten months that we have owned CORT, its revenues have totaled
$361 million. Of this, $306 million was furniture rental revenue and $55 million wasfurniture sales revenue. CORT contributed $29 million to Wesco's consolidatedoperating income in 2000, before goodwill amortization of $5.1 million or realizedsecurities losses of $.7 million. CORT's pre-tax operating income (before goodwillamortization) for the entire calendar year 2000 was $54.3 million.
Thus, in essence, Wesco paid $386 million for $54.3 million in pre-tax operatingearnings. About 60% of the purchase price was attributable to goodwill, an intangiblebalance sheet asset.
Wesco's consolidated balance sheet now contains about $260 million in good-
will (including $28 million from Wesco's 1996 purchase of KBS). On a full yearbasis, Wesco's reported earnings for 2000 were reduced by about $6 million ofmostly-non-tax-deductible amortization of goodwill. I am pleased to report that the
Financial Accounting Standards Board has recently proposed a rule that, if adopted,
will no longer require automatic amortization of acquired goodwill. If this proposedrule change goes into eÅect, our reported earnings will more closely reÖectmicroeconomic reality as we appraise it.
More details with respect to CORT are contained throughout this annual report,
to which your careful attention is directed.
CORT has long been headed by Paul Arnold, age 54, who is a star executive as isconvincingly demonstrated by his long record as CEO of CORT. We are absolutelydelighted to have Paul and CORT within Wesco, are pleased with CORT's perform-
ance under his leadership in 2000, and hope to see a considerable expansion of
CORT's business and earnings in future years.
Commencing late last year, and continuing to date, new business coming into
CORT has declined sharply. We believe that CORT's operations will remain proÑta-
ble in any likely recession-related decline in the rent-to-rent segment of the furniturebusiness.

The purchase of CORT has increased Wesco's employee count to approxi-
mately 3,000 from 275 one year earlier.
Precision Steel Warehouse, Inc. (""Precision Steel'')
The businesses of Wesco's Precision Steel subsidiary, headquartered in theoutskirts of Chicago at Franklin Park, Illinois, contributed $1.3 million to Wesco's netoperating earnings in 2000, down from the $2.5 million contributed in 1999. The
50% decline in 2000 operating earnings was due principally to two factors: (1) LIFO
inventory accounting adjustments decreased after-tax earnings approximately
$.4 million in 2000 after increasing such earnings by $.3 million in 1999, and
(2) pounds of product sold decreased 3%, while competition restrained prices ascosts of principal raw materials increased, causing fewer dollars of gross proÑt to beavailable to absorb operating expenses. Revenues were up only 1%.
Generally, the U.S. steel business was a disaster in 2000, and Precision SteelsuÅered worse eÅects than occurred for it in previous general declines in the U.S.
steel business.
We do not regard earnings changes from LIFO accounting adjustments, up ordown, as material in predicting future earning power.
Terry Piper, who became Precision Steel's President and Chief Executive oCcerlate in 1999, has done an excellent job in leading Precision Steel through a verydiCcult year.
Tag Ends from Savings and Loan Days
All that now remains outside Wes-FIC but within Wesco as a consequence of
Wesco's former involvement with Mutual Savings, Wesco's long-held savings andloan subsidiary, is a small real estate subsidiary, MS Property Company, that holds tagends of real estate assets with a net book value of about $6.5 million. MS Property
Company's results of operations, immaterial versus Wesco's present size, areincluded in the breakdown of earnings on page 1 within ""other operating earnings.''
Other Operating Earnings
Other operating earnings, net of interest paid and general corporate expenses,
amounted to $.2 million in 2000 and $.7 million in 1999. Sources were (1) rents
($3 million gross in 2000) from Wesco's Pasadena oCce property (leased almostentirely to outsiders, including California Federal Bank as the ground Öoor tenant),
and (2) interest and dividends from cash equivalents and marketable securities heldoutside the insurance subsidiaries, less (3) general corporate expenses plus minorexpenses involving tag-end real estate.
Realized Net Securities Gains
The main tag end from Wesco's savings and loan days was an investment in
Freddie Mac common stock, purchased by Mutual Savings for $72 million at a time

when Freddie Mac shares could be lawfully owned only by a savings and loanassociation. Those shares, carried on Wesco's balance sheet at yearend 1999 at amarket value of $1.4 billion, were sold in 2000, giving rise to the principal portion ofthe $852.4 million of after-tax securities gains realized by Wesco in 2000, versus
$7.3 million, after taxes, realized in 1999.
Although the realized gains materially impacted Wesco's reported earnings foreach year, they had a very minor impact on Wesco's shareholders' equity. Inasmuch asthe greater portion of each year's realized gains had previously been reÖected in theunrealized gain component of Wesco's shareholders' equity, those amounts weremerely switched from unrealized gains to retained earnings, another component ofshareholders' equity.
Consolidated Balance Sheet and Related Discussion
As indicated in the accompanying Ñnancial statements, Wesco's net worth, asaccountants compute it under their conventions, increased to $1.98 billion ($278
per Wesco share) at yearend 2000 from $1.90 billion ($266 per Wesco share) atyearend 1999.
The foregoing $278-per-share book value approximates liquidation value assum-
ing that all Wesco's non-security assets would liquidate, after taxes, at book value.
Probably, this assumption is too conservative. But our computation of liquidationvalue is unlikely to be too low by any large percentage because (1) the liquidationvalue of Wesco's consolidated real estate holdings (where interesting potential nowlies almost entirely in Wesco's equity in its oCce property in Pasadena containingonly 125,000 net rentable square feet), and (2) possible unrealized appreciation inother assets (primarily CORT and Precision Steel) cannot be large enough, inrelation to Wesco's overall size, to change very much the overall computation ofafter-tax liquidating value.
Of course, so long as Wesco does not liquidate, and does not sell anyappreciated securities, it has, in eÅect, an interest-free ""loan'' from the governmentequal to its deferred income taxes on the unrealized gains, subtracted in determiningits net worth. The sale of the Freddie Mac shares in 2000 reduced that interest-free
""loan'' from $705 million as of yearend 1999 to $258 million as of yearend 2000. Thisinterest-free ""loan'' from the government is at this moment working for Wescoshareholders and amounted only to about $36 per Wesco share at year end 2000.
However, some day, additional parts of the interest-free ""loan'' may beremoved as securities are sold, as happened to such a large extent with the sale of
Freddie Mac stock in 2000. Therefore, Wesco's shareholders have no perpetualadvantage creating value for them of $36 per Wesco share. Instead, the presentvalue of Wesco's shareholders' advantage must logically be much lower than $36 per
Wesco share.
Business and human quality in place at Wesco continues to be not nearly asgood, all factors considered, as that in place at Berkshire Hathaway. Wesco is not an

equally-good-but-smaller version of Berkshire Hathaway, better because its smallsize makes growth easier. Instead, each dollar of book value at Wesco continuesplainly to provide much less intrinsic value than a similar dollar of book value at
Berkshire Hathaway. Moreover, the quality disparity in book value's intrinsic meritshas, in recent years, continued to widen in favor of Berkshire Hathaway.
All that said, we make no attempt to appraise relative attractiveness for invest-
ment of Wesco versus Berkshire Hathaway stock at present stock-market quotations.
To progress from this point at a satisfactory rate, Wesco plainly needs morefavorable investment opportunities, recognizable as such by its management, prefer-
ably in whole companies like CORT, but, alternatively, in marketable securities to bepurchased by Wesco's insurance subsidiaries.
The Board of Directors recently increased Wesco's regular dividend from 30¥
cents per share to 31¥ cents per share, payable March 7, 2001, to shareholders ofrecord as of the close of business on February 7, 2001.
This annual report contains Form 10-K, a report Ñled with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, and includes detailed information about Wesco and itssubsidiaries as well as audited Ñnancial statements bearing extensive footnotes. Asusual, your careful attention is sought with respect to these items.
