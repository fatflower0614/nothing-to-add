(1) All Ñgures are net of income taxes.
(2) Per-share data are based on 7,119,807 shares outstanding. Wesco has had no dilutive capital stock equivalents.
(3) In accordance with a new pronouncement of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, Wesco will no longer be requiredto amortize goodwill beginning in 2002. The requirement for such amortization has been replaced by a standard thatrequires an annual assessment to determine whether the value of goodwill has been impaired, at which time the intangiblewould be written down or written oÅ, as appropriate.
(4) After deduction of interest and other corporate expenses, and costs and expenses associated with foreclosed real estatepreviously charged against Wesco's former Mutual Savings and Loan Association subsidiary. Income was from ownershipof the Wesco headquarters oCce building, primarily leased to outside tenants, and interest and dividend income from cashequivalents and marketable securities owned outside the insurance subsidiaries.
This supplementary breakdown of earnings diÅers somewhat from that used inaudited Ñnancial statements which follow standard accounting convention. Theforegoing supplementary breakdown is furnished because it is considered useful to

shareholders. The total consolidated net income shown above is, of course, identicalto the total in our audited Ñnancial statements.
Insurance Businesses
Consolidated operating earnings from insurance businesses represent the com-
bination of the results of their insurance underwriting with their net investmentincome. Following is a summary of these Ñgures as they pertain to all insuranceoperations except The Kansas Bankers Surety Company (""KBS''), which is sepa-
rately discussed below.

As shown above, operating income includes signiÑcant net investment income,
representing dividends and interest earned from marketable securities. However,
operating income excludes realized net securities gains, net of income taxes, of
$853.1 million in 2000. There were no such gains in 2001. Our discussion willconcentrate on insurance underwriting, not on the results from investments.
Results for 2001 from insurance underwriting, other than at KBS, were the worstsince we entered into the insurance business in 1985.
The nature of our non-KBS insurance business was roughly described in our year
Annual Report wherein we reported to shareholders that we were not currentlyactive in super-catastrophe reinsurance and had never suÅered a super-catastropheloss, but that shareholders should continue to realize that Wes-FIC's marvelousunderwriting results were sure to be followed, sometime, by one or more horribleunderwriting losses.
When we said that, we had in mind a natural catastrophe. But, instead, we wereclobbered by a man-made catastrophe on September 11 Ì an event that deliveredthe insurance industry its largest loss in history. Fortunately, we recorded a loss ofonly $10 million, before income taxes ($6.5 million, after taxes) in connection withthat event. The $10 million is an estimate and is subject to considerable estimationerror. It will literally take years to resolve complicated coverage issues, as well as todevelop an accurate estimation of insured losses that will ultimately be incurred. That
$10 million, however, was the principal cause of our substantial underwriting loss in
2001.
At the end of 2001 we retained about $17 million in invested assets, oÅset byclaims reserves, from our former reinsurance arrangement with Fireman's Fund
Group. This arrangement was terminated August 31, 1989. However, it will take along time before all claims are settled, and, meanwhile, Wes-FIC is being helpedover many years by proceeds from investing ""Öoat'' and by favorable loss develop-
ment, which has enabled it to reduce the liability for losses and loss-related

expenses, beneÑting after-tax operating earnings in 2001 and 2000 by $.8 millioneach.
We engage in other reinsurance business, including large and small quota sharearrangements similar and dissimilar to our previous reinsurance contract with Fire-
man's Fund Group, and, from time to time, in super-cat reinsurance, described indetail in previous annual reports, which Wesco shareholders should re-read eachyear.
In almost all recent reinsurance sold by us, other subsidiaries of our 80%-owningparent, Berkshire Hathaway, sold several times as much reinsurance to the samecustomers on the same terms. In certain instances, such subsidiaries have taken fromus a 3%-of-premiums ceding commission on premium volume passed through themto Wes-FIC. Excepting this ceding commission, Wes-FIC has had virtually noinsurance-acquisition or insurance administration costs with regard to those policies.
KBS, purchased by Wes-FIC in 1996 for approximately $80 million in cash,
contributed $9.3 million to the after-tax operating earnings of the insurance busi-
nesses in 2001 and $7.0 million in 2000. These Ñgures are before goodwill amortiza-
tion under accounting convention of $.8 million each year. The results of KBS havebeen combined with those of Wes-FIC, and are included in the table on page 1 inthe category of ""insurance businesses.''
KBS was chartered in 1909 to underwrite deposit insurance for Kansas banks. ItsoCces are in Topeka, Kansas. Over the years its service has continued to adapt to thechanging needs of the banking industry. Today its customer base, consisting mostlyof small and medium-sized community banks, is spread throughout 27 mainlymidwestern states. In addition to bank deposit guaranty bonds which insure depositsin excess of FDIC coverage, KBS also oÅers directors and oCcers indemnity policies,
bank employment practices policies, bank annuity and mutual funds indemnitypolicies and bank insurance agents professional errors and omissions indemnitypolicies.
KBS increased the volume of business retained eÅective in 1998. It hadpreviously ceded almost half of its premium volume to reinsurers. Now it reinsuresonly about 5% under arrangements whereby other Berkshire subsidiaries take 50%
and unrelated reinsurers take the other 50%. As we indicated last year, the increasedvolume of business retained comes, of course, with increased irregularity in theincome stream.
The combined ratio of an insurance company represents the percentage that itsunderwriting losses and expenses bear to its premium revenues. KBS's combinedratio has been much better than average for insurers, at 55.1% for 2001 and 73.9%
for 2000, and we continue to expect volatile but favorable long-term eÅects fromincreased insurance retained.
KBS is ably run by Donald Towle, President, assisted by 15 dedicated oCcersand employees.

CORT Business Services Corporation (""CORT'')
In February 2000, Wesco purchased CORT Business Services Corporation
(""CORT'') for $386 million in cash.
CORT is a very long established company that is the country's leader in rentalsof furniture that lessees have no intention of buying. In the trade, people call CORT'sactivity ""rent-to-rent'' to distinguish it from ""lease-to-purchase'' businesses that are,
in essence, installment sellers of furniture.
However, just as Hertz, as a rent-to-rent auto lessor in short-term arrangements,
must be skilled in selling used cars, CORT must be and is skilled in selling usedfurniture.
CORT's revenues totaled $395 million for calendar 2001, versus $361 million forthe ten months that we owned it in the year 2000. Of these amounts, furniture rentalrevenues were $329 million and $306 million, and furniture sales revenues were
$66 million and $55 million. CORT contributed $13.1 million to Wesco's consoli-
dated operating income for the entire year of 2001, versus $29.0 million for the tenmonths of 2000. These Ñgures are before (1) goodwill amortization of $6.0 millionfor 2001 and $5.1 million for 2000, and (2) realized securities losses of $.7 million in
2000.
CORT's after-tax operating income (before goodwill amortization) for the entirecalendar year 2000 was $33.4 million compared to only $13.1 million for 2001, adecline of 61%.
When we purchased CORT early in 2000, its furniture rental business wasrapidly growing, reÖecting the strong U.S. economy, phenomenal business expansionand explosive growth of IPOs and the high-tech sector. Beginning late in 2000,
however, new business coming into CORT began to decline. With the burst of thedot-com bubble, continued weakness in the economy and the events of Septem-
ber 11, CORT's operations were hammered in 2001.
Moreover, CORT started up a new subsidiary during the year, Relocation Central
Corporation, whose $12 million in expenses far exceeded its $1 million in revenues.
The results of its operations have been consolidated with those reported for CORT,
shown above. Relocation Central has developed a virtual call center which carriesoutaninternet-basedfurnitureandapartmentleadsoperation
(www.relocationcentral.com), and it has begun marketing CORT's furniture rentalservices to real estate investment trusts, owners of many major apartment communi-
ties. CORT is hopeful that, through Relocation Central, it will ultimately become theprincipal source of rental furniture to the apartment industry.
We hope to report in due course that all CORT operations have become moresatisfactory, but prospects for 2002 do not thrill us. However, there is good newsalong with bad. CORT operates at a positive cash Öow. During 2001 it reduced itsline-of-credit debt by $32 million and invested an additional $20 million in businessexpansion through acquisitions of several small businesses. We happily tolerate a

poor part of the business cycle when we turn it to our advantage by expandingbusiness through cash acquisition at sound prices. We continue to believe that
CORT's operations will remain proÑtable in any likely recession-related decline inthe rent-to-rent segment of the furniture business.
When Wesco paid $386 million for CORT, about 60% of the purchase price wasattributable to goodwill, an intangible balance sheet asset.
Wesco's consolidated balance sheet now contains about $264 million in good-
will (including $27 million from Wesco's 1996 purchase of KBS). Wesco's reportedearnings were reduced by about $7 million of mostly-non-tax-deductible amortiza-
tion of goodwill for 2001 and $6 million for 2000. The Financial Accounting
Standards Board has recently adopted a rule that will no longer require automaticamortization of acquired goodwill beginning in 2002. Thus, earnings we report in thefuture will more closely reÖect microeconomic reality as we appraise it.
More details with respect to CORT are contained throughout this annual report,
to which your careful attention is directed.
CORT has long been headed by Paul Arnold, age 55, who is a star executive as isconvincingly demonstrated by his long record as CEO of CORT. We are absolutelydelighted to have Paul and CORT within Wesco, are pleased with CORT's perform-
ance under his leadership, despite adverse developments in 2001, and we hope tosee a considerable expansion of CORT's business and earnings in future years.
Precision Steel Warehouse, Inc. (""Precision Steel'')
The businesses of Wesco's Precision Steel subsidiary, headquartered in theoutskirts of Chicago at Franklin Park, Illinois, contributed $.4 million to Wesco's netoperating earnings in 2001, down from $1.3 million in 2000 and $2.5 million in 1999.
Had it not been for LIFO inventory accounting adjustments, Precision Steel wouldhave reported no income at all for the year 2001, versus $1.7 million, after taxes, for
2000.
Last year we reported that the U.S. steel industry was generally a disaster in
2000, and that Precision Steel suÅered worse eÅects than occurred for it in previousgeneral declines in the U.S. steel business. The year 2001 was much worse. Theabsence of Precision Steel's operating earnings for 2001, before the eÅect of the
LIFO adjustment, was due principally to a signiÑcant reduction in demand for steel,
combined with intensiÑed competition above the Ñerce level encountered in theprior year. This resulted in a 29.7% decrease in pounds of product sold. Salesrevenues declined 25.6%.
We do not regard earnings changes from LIFO accounting adjustments, up ordown, as material in predicting future earning power.
Terry Piper, who became Precision Steel's President and Chief Executive OCcerlate in 1999, has done an excellent job in leading Precision Steel through diCcultyears.

Tag Ends from Savings and Loan Days
All that now remains outside Wes-FIC but within Wesco as a consequence of
Wesco's former involvement with Mutual Savings, Wesco's long-held savings andloan subsidiary, is a small real estate subsidiary, MS Property Company, that holds tagends of real estate assets with a net book value of about $5.8 million, consistingmainly of the nine-story commercial oCce building in downtown Pasadena, where
Wesco is headquartered. MS Property Company's results of operations, immaterialversus Wesco's present size, are included in the breakdown of earnings on page 1
within ""other operating earnings.''
Other Operating Earnings
Other operating earnings, net of interest paid and general corporate expenses,
amounted to $.6 million in 2001 and $.2 million in 2000. Sources were (1) rents
($3.2 million gross in 2001) from Wesco's Pasadena oCce property (leased almostentirely to outsiders, including California Federal Bank as the ground Öoor tenant),
and (2) interest and dividends from cash equivalents and marketable securities heldoutside the insurance subsidiaries, less (3) general corporate expenses plus minorexpenses involving tag-end real estate.
Realized Net Securities Gains
The main tag end from Wesco's savings and loan days was an investment in
Freddie Mac common stock, purchased by Mutual Savings for $72 million at a timewhen Freddie Mac shares could be lawfully owned only by a savings and loanassociation. Those shares, carried on Wesco's balance sheet at yearend 1999 at amarket value of $1.4 billion, were sold in 2000, giving rise to the principal portion ofthe $852.4 million of after-tax securities gains realized by Wesco in 2000, versus nogains or losses realized in 2001.
Although the realized gain had a material impact on Wesco's reported earningsfor 2000, it had a very minor impact on Wesco's shareholders' equity. Inasmuch as thegreater portion of the realized gain had previously been reÖected in the unrealizedgain component of Wesco's shareholders' equity, the amount was merely switchedfrom unrealized gains to retained earnings, another component of shareholders'
equity.
Consolidated Balance Sheet and Related Discussion
As indicated in the accompanying Ñnancial statements, Wesco's net worth, asaccountants compute it under their conventions, decreased to $1.91 billion ($269
per Wesco share) at yearend 2001 from $1.98 billion ($278 per Wesco share) atyearend 2000.
The foregoing $269-per-share book value approximates liquidation value assum-
ing that all Wesco's non-security assets would liquidate, after taxes, at book value.
Perhaps this assumption is too conservative. But our computation of liquidationvalue is unlikely to be too low by any large percentage because (1) the liquidation

value of Wesco's consolidated real estate holdings (where interesting potential nowlies almost entirely in Wesco's equity in its oCce property in Pasadena containingonly 125,000 net rentable square feet), and (2) possible unrealized appreciation inother assets cannot be large enough, in relation to Wesco's overall size, to changevery much the overall computation of after-tax liquidating value.
Of course, so long as Wesco does not liquidate, and does not sell anyappreciated securities, it has, in eÅect, an interest-free ""loan'' from the governmentequal to its deferred income taxes on the unrealized gains, subtracted in determiningits net worth. The sale of the Freddie Mac shares in 2000 was principally responsiblefor the reduction of that interest-free ""loan'' from $705 million as of yearend 1999 to
$199 million as of yearend 2001. This interest-free ""loan'' from the government is atthis moment working for Wesco shareholders and amounted to about $28 per
Wesco share at year end 2001.
However, some day, additional parts of the interest-free ""loan'' may be re-
moved as securities are sold, as happened to such a large extent with the sale of
Freddie Mac stock in 2000. Therefore, Wesco's shareholders have no perpetualadvantage creating value for them of $28 per Wesco share. Instead, the presentvalue of Wesco's shareholders' advantage must logically be much lower than $28 per
Wesco share.
Business and human quality in place at Wesco continues to be not nearly asgood, all factors considered, as that in place at Berkshire Hathaway. Wesco is not anequally-good-but-smaller version of Berkshire Hathaway, better because its smallsize makes growth easier. Instead, each dollar of book value at Wesco continuesplainly to provide much less intrinsic value than a similar dollar of book value at
Berkshire Hathaway. Moreover, the quality disparity in book value's intrinsic meritshas, in recent years, continued to widen in favor of Berkshire Hathaway.
All that said, we make no attempt to appraise relative attractiveness for invest-
ment of Wesco versus Berkshire Hathaway stock at present stock-market quotations.
To progress from this point at a satisfactory rate, Wesco plainly needs morefavorable investment opportunities, recognizable as such by its management, prefer-
ably in whole companies like CORT, but, alternatively, in marketable securities to bepurchased by Wesco's insurance subsidiaries.
The thing that should interest Wesco shareholders most with respect to 2001 isthat we found no new common stocks for our insurance companies to buy. We arenot excited by general prospects for common stocks.
The Board of Directors recently increased Wesco's regular dividend from 311/2
cents per share to 321/2 cents per share, payable March 6, 2002, to shareholders ofrecord as of the close of business on February 6, 2002.

This annual report contains Form 10-K, a report Ñled with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, and includes detailed information about Wesco and itssubsidiaries as well as audited Ñnancial statements bearing extensive footnotes. Asusual, your careful attention is sought with respect to these items.
