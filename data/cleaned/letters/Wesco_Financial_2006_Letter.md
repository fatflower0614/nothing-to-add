Although no cash was received, generally accepted accounting principles required that the gain be recorded. Because
Wesco's balance sheet reÖects investments carried at market value, with unrealized gains, after applicable income tax eÅect,
included in shareholders' equity, the transaction did not aÅect Wesco's shareholders' equity. It merely resulted in areclassiÑcation from unrealized gains to retained earnings, another component of shareholders' equity.
This supplementary breakdown of earnings diÅers somewhat from that used in audited
Ñnancial statements which follow standard accounting convention. The foregoing

supplementary breakdown is furnished because it is considered useful to shareholders.
The total consolidated net income shown above is, of course, identical to the total inour audited Ñnancial statements.

As shown above, operating income includes signiÑcant net investment income,
representing dividends and interest earned from marketable securities. However,

operating income excludes investment gains of $216.6 million, net of income taxes,
realized in 2005. No investment gains or losses were realized in 2006. The discussionbelow will concentrate on insurance underwriting, not on the results from investments.
Wes-FIC engages in the reinsurance business. For the past several years, itsreinsurance activity has consisted of the participation in several risk pools managed byan insurance subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, our 80%-owning parent. Thearrangement became eÅective in 2001 and most recently covered hull, liability andworkers' compensation exposures relating to the aviation industry, as follows: for 2005,
to the extent of 10% in the hull and liability pools and 5% of a workers' compensationpool; for 2006, 121/2% of the hull and liability pools and 5% of the workers'
compensation pool. For 2007, participation in the hull and liability pools has increasedto 16.67%. The Berkshire subsidiary provides a portion of the upper-level reinsuranceprotection to these aviation risk pools on terms that could result in the Berkshiresubsidiary having a diÅerent interest from that of Wes-FIC under certain conditions,
e.g., in settling a large loss.
Wes-FIC's underwriting results have Öuctuated from year to year, but have beensatisfactory. When stated as a percentage, the sum of insurance losses, loss adjustmentexpenses and underwriting expenses, divided by premiums, gives the combined ratio.
The combined ratios of Wes-FIC have been much better than average for insurers.
Wes-FIC's combined ratios were 94.0% for 2006 and 75.9% for 2005. We try to createsome underwriting gain as results are averaged out over many years. We expect this tobecome increasingly diCcult.
Kansas Bankers was purchased by Wes-FIC in 1996 for approximately $80 millionin cash. Its tangible net worth now exceeds its acquisition price, and it has been a verysatisfactory acquisition, reÖecting the sound management of President Don Towle andhis team.
Kansas Bankers was chartered in 1909 to underwrite deposit insurance for Kansasbanks. Its oCces are in Topeka, Kansas. Over the years its service has continued toadapt to the changing needs of the banking industry. Today its customer base,
consisting mostly of small- and medium-sized community banks, is spread throughoutmainly midwestern states. In addition to bank deposit guaranty bonds which insuredeposits in excess of FDIC coverage, KBS oÅers directors and oCcers indemnitypolicies, bank employment practices policies, bank insurance agents professional errorsand omissions indemnity policies and Internet banking catastrophe theft insurance.
When Wesco purchased KBS, it had been ceding almost half of its premiumvolume to reinsurers. Now it reinsures only about 14%. EÅective in 2006, insurancesubsidiaries of Berkshire Hathaway became KBS's sole reinsurers. Previously, anunaCliated reinsurer was also involved. The increased volume of business retainedcomes, of course, with increased irregularity in the income stream. KBS's combinedratios were 73.8% for 2006 and 58.8% for 2005. We continue to expect volatile butfavorable long-term eÅects from increased insurance retained.
CORT Business Services Corporation (""CORT'')
In February 2000, Wesco purchased CORT Business Services Corporation
(""CORT'') for $386 million in cash.

CORT is a very long-established company that is the country's leader in rentals offurniture that lessees have no intention of buying. In the trade, people call CORT'sactivity ""rent-to-rent'' to distinguish it from ""lease-to-purchase'' businesses that are, inessence, installment sellers of furniture.
However, just as Enterprise, as a rent-to-rent auto lessor in short-termarrangements, must be skilled in selling used cars, CORT must be and is skilled inselling used furniture.
CORT's revenues totaled $400 million for calendar 2006, versus $384 million forcalendar 2005. Of these amounts, furniture rental revenues were $324 million and
$304 million, furniture sales revenues were $70 million and $72 million, and apartmentlocator fees of its relocation division were $6 million and $8 million. CORT operated atan after-tax proÑt of $26.9 million for 2006, up satisfactorily from its $20.7 million ofafter-tax proÑt for 2005 (versus $5.0 million for 2004). These results reÖect thefavorable eÅects of several ""tuck-in'' acquisitions made between the years 2001
and 2004.
When we purchased CORT early in 2000, its furniture rental business was rapidlygrowing, reÖecting the strong U.S. economy, phenomenal business expansion andexplosive growth of IPOs and the high-tech sector.
Beginning late in 2000, however, new business coming into CORT began todecline. With the burst of the dot-com bubble, the events of September 11, and aprotracted slowdown in new business formation, CORT's operations were hammered,
reÖecting generally bad results in the ""rent-to-rent'' segment of the furniture rentalbusiness. Obviously, when we purchased CORT we were poor predictors of near-termindustry-wide prospects of the ""rent-to-rent'' sector of the furniture business.
CORT started up a new service during 2001. Originally a subsidiary named
Relocation Central, and now its CORTline division, it was conceived mainly tosupplement CORT's furniture rental business by providing apartment locator andancillary services to relocating individuals. Long CORT's star CEO, Paul Arnold is inprocess of expanding CORTline's operations and redirecting its marketing, with theexpectation that it will become a Ñnancial success. CORTline, originally conceived toassist relocating individuals, has recently expanded its services and capabilities and hasbegun to market itself toward the needs of businesses and governmental agencies whorequire a skilled and able partner to provide the full gamut of seamless relocationservices for the temporary relocation of employees. With several websites, principally,
www.cortline.com, www.relocationcentral.com and www.apartmentsearch.com,
professionals in more than 80 domestic metropolitan markets, aCliates in more than 50
countries, almost twenty thousand apartment communities referring their tenants to
CORT, many ancillary services, and its entr πee to the business community as a Berkshire
Hathaway company, CORTline now seems to be moving in the right direction.
We are pleased with the progress CORT made in the past two years. We arecautiously optimistic that, in future years, we will be able to look back to the recentpast and consider it merely a cyclical aberration in CORT's growth. We note, however,
that the number of furniture leases outstanding has been slightly declining in each ofthe past two years.

When Wesco paid $386 million for CORT, about 60% of the purchase price wasattributable to goodwill, an intangible balance sheet asset. Wesco's consolidatedbalance sheet now contains about $267 million in goodwill (including $27 million from
Wesco's 1996 purchase of KBS). The Financial Accounting Standards Board adopted arule which became eÅective in 2002 that no longer requires automatic amortization ofacquired goodwill. (The requirement for such amortization has been replaced by astandard that requires an annual assessment to determine whether the value ofgoodwill has been impaired, in which event the intangible asset would be written downor written oÅ, as appropriate.) Earnings, not reduced by goodwill amortization, that wehave reported since 2002 more closely reÖect microeconomic reality as we appraise it.
More details with respect to CORT are contained throughout this annual report, towhich your careful attention is directed.
Precision Steel Warehouse, Inc. (""Precision Steel'')
The businesses of Wesco's Precision Steel subsidiary, headquartered in theoutskirts of Chicago at Franklin Park, Illinois, operated at after-tax proÑts of $1.2 millionin both 2006 and 2005. These Ñgures reÖect after-tax LIFO inventory accountingadjustments decreasing after-tax income by $.6 million for 2006 and $.2 million for
2005. Precision Steel's operating results for 2006 also reÖect expenses, net of insurancerecoveries, of $.3 million, after taxes, in connection with environmental cleanup of anindustrial park where a Precision Steel subsidiary has operated alongside approximatelyother manufacturers for many years. Had it not been for the LIFO accountingadjustments or the environmental matter, Precision Steel would have reported after-taxoperating income of $2.1 million for 2006 and $1.4 million for 2005.
Precision Steel's business has been subject to economic cycles. Although the
Ñercely competitive, chaotic pressures aÅecting its steel service center business (whichwe described at length in last year's shareholders' letter) have recently abated,
Precision Steel is continuing to suÅer the ongoing eÅects of a long-term reduction indemand caused by customers' (or former customers') unsuccessful competition withmanufacturers outside the United States. Precision Steel's revenues increased 2.8% in
2006, approximately half of which was due to an extraordinary order of shimstock andother industrial supplies from a customer of its Precision Brand Products subsidiary.
Revenues for 2005 increased by 1.4% from those of 2004. In 2006, Precision Steel'sservice center volume was 46 million pounds, down from 69 million pounds sold asrecently as 1999. This decline in physical volume is a serious reverse, not likely todisappear in some ""bounce back'' eÅect. Nor do we expect another sharp rise in priceslike the approximately 40% rise that recently occurred, holding dollar volume roughlylevel despite a precipitous drop in physical volume.
Although Precision Steel's recent after-tax operating earnings of approximately
$1 million per year may signal improvement when compared with its after-taxoperating loss of $.9 million for 2003, we do not consider present operating results tobe a satisfactory investment outcome. Recent earnings of Precision Steel compareunfavorably with operating earnings which averaged $2.3 million, after taxes, for theyears 1998 through 2000. Because the steel warehouse business may revert to evenmore diCcult conditions, more decline for Precision Steel may lie ahead.

Terry Piper, who became Precision Steel's President and Chief Executive OCcer in
1999, has done an outstanding job in leading Precision Steel through very diCcultyears. But he has no magic wand with which to compensate for competitive lossesamong his best customers.
Tag Ends from Savings and Loan Days
All that now remains outside Wes-FIC but within Wesco as a consequence of
Wesco's former involvement with Mutual Savings, Wesco's long-held savings and loansubsidiary, is a small real estate subsidiary, MS Property Company, that holds tag endsof appreciated real estate assets consisting mainly of the nine-story commercial oCcebuilding in downtown Pasadena, where Wesco is headquartered. Adjacent to thatbuilding is a parcel of land on which we are building a multi-story luxury condominiumbuilding. We are also seeking city approval of our plans to build another multi-storyluxury condominium building on a vacant parcel of land in the next block. For moreinformation, if you want a very-high-end condominium, simply phone Bob Sahm
(626-585-6700). MS Property Company's results of operations, immaterial versus
Wesco's present size, are included in the breakdown of earnings on page 1 within
""other operating earnings.''
Other Operating Earnings
Other operating earnings, net of interest paid and general corporate expenses,
amounted to $.2 million in 2006, versus $5.2 million in 2005. Had it not been forfavorable income tax adjustments of $4.9 million recorded in 2005, other operatingearnings would have been $.3 million in 2005. The sources of the $.2 million of otheroperating earnings in 2006 were (1) rents ($3.7 million gross in 2006) principally from
Wesco's Pasadena oCce property (leased almost entirely to outsiders, including
Citibank as the ground Öoor tenant), and (2) interest and dividends from cashequivalents and marketable securities held outside the insurance subsidiaries, less
(3) general corporate expenses plus minor expenses involving tag-end real estate.
Realized Investment Gains
There were no realized investment gains in 2006. Wesco's 2005 earningscontained investment gains of $216.6 million, after income taxes. Only $.5 million wasrealized through the sale of investments; the balance, $216.1 million, resulted from thetax-free exchange of common shares of The Gillette Company (""Gillette'') owned by
Wesco, for common shares of The Procter & Gamble Company (""PG'') in the fourthquarter of 2005 in connection with the merger of Gillette with PG. Accountingstandards promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board require that thefair (market) value of shares received in such an exchange be recorded as the newcost basis as of the date of the exchange, with the diÅerence between the new basisand the historical cost realized in the audited Ñnancial statements as an investmentgain. For tax return purposes, the securities acquired were recorded at the original costof the securities exchanged. Thus, no income tax was due or paid.
Although the realized gain had a material impact on Wesco's reported 2005
earnings, it had no impact on Wesco's shareholders' equity. Wesco carries itsinvestments at fair value, with unrealized appreciation, after income tax eÅect,
included as a separate component of shareholders' equity, and related taxes included

in income taxes payable, on its consolidated balance sheet. Thus, the entire after-taxgain on the non-cash merger had been reÖected in the unrealized gain component of
Wesco's shareholders' equity as of September 30, 2005. That amount was merelyswitched from unrealized gain to retained earnings, another component ofshareholders' equity. This accounting entry had no economic eÅect on Wesco, and youshould ignore it when you are evaluating Wesco's 2005 earnings.
Consolidated Balance Sheet and Related Discussion
As indicated in the accompanying Ñnancial statements, Wesco's net worth, asaccountants compute it under their conventions, increased to $2.40 billion ($337 per
Wesco share) at yearend 2006 from $2.23 billion ($313 per Wesco share) at yearend
2005. The main causes of the increase were appreciation in fair value of investments,
and net operating income after deduction of dividends paid to shareholders.
The foregoing $337-per-share book value approximates liquidation value assumingthat all Wesco's non-security assets would liquidate, after taxes, at book value.
Of course, so long as Wesco does not liquidate, and does not sell any appreciatedsecurities, including the PG shares Wesco received in connection with PG's acquisitionof Gillette in 2005, discussed above in the section, ""Realized Investment Gains,''
Wesco has, in eÅect, an interest-free ""loan'' from the government equal to its deferredincome taxes, subtracted in determining its net worth. This interest-free ""loan'' fromthe government is at this moment working for Wesco shareholders and amounted toabout $42 per Wesco share at yearend 2006.
However, some day, parts of the interest-free ""loan'' may be removed as securitiesare sold. Therefore, Wesco's shareholders have no perpetual advantage creating valuefor them of $42 per Wesco share. Instead, the present value of Wesco's shareholders'
advantage must logically be much lower than $42 per Wesco share.
Business and human quality in place at Wesco continues to be not nearly as good,
all factors considered, as that in place at Berkshire Hathaway. Wesco is not an equally-
good-but-smaller version of Berkshire Hathaway, better because its small size makesgrowth easier. Instead, each dollar of book value at Wesco continues plainly to providemuch less intrinsic value than a similar dollar of book value at Berkshire Hathaway.
Moreover, the quality disparity in book value's intrinsic merits has, in recent years,
continued to widen in favor of Berkshire Hathaway.
All that said, we make no attempt to appraise relative attractiveness for investmentof Wesco versus Berkshire Hathaway stock at present stock-market quotations.
Wesco's consolidated balance sheet reÖects total assets of $3.0 billion as ofyearend 2006. Of that amount, more than $1 billion has been invested in cashequivalents and Ñxed-maturity investments since early in 2003. Unless those funds canbe attractively reinvested in acquisitions, equity securities or other long-terminstruments of the type that helped cause the long-term growth of Wesco'sshareholders' equity, future returns on shareholders' equity will probably be less thanthose of the past. Due to the current size of Wesco and its parent, Berkshire Hathaway,
Wesco's opportunities for growing shareholders' equity are unlikely to be as attractiveas in the past.

Wesco's shares were listed for many years on both the American Stock Exchangeand, since 1963, on a regional exchange previously known as the PaciÑc Stock
Exchange. Following the recent merger of various regional exchanges into the NYSE,
the PaciÑc Exchange became the NYSE Arca exchange. We had happily paid a minimalannual listing fee of $1,000 for the privilege of having our shares listed on the PaciÑc
Exchange. When notiÑed last December that NYSE Arca had decided to increase
Wesco's annual listing fee to $30,000, Wesco voted with its feet. Its shares are nowlisted only on the American Exchange.
The Board of Directors recently increased Wesco's regular dividend from
361/2 cents per share to 371/2 cents per share, payable March 8, 2007, to shareholders ofrecord as of the close of business on February 1, 2007.
This annual report contains Form 10-K, a report Ñled with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, and includes detailed information about Wesco and itssubsidiaries as well as audited Ñnancial statements bearing extensive footnotes. Asusual, your careful attention is sought with respect to these items.
Shareholders can access much Wesco information, including printed annualreports, earnings releases, SEC Ñlings, and the websites of Wesco's subsidiaries andparent, Berkshire Hathaway, from Wesco's website: www.wescoÑnancial.com.
