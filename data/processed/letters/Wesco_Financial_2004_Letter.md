As shown above, operating income includes significant net investment income,
representing dividends and interest earned from marketable securities. However,
operating income excludes investment gains of $34.8 million, net of income taxes,
realized in 2003. No investment gains or losses were realized in 2004. The discussion
below will concentrate on insurance underwriting, not on the results from investments.
Wes-FIC engages in the reinsurance business, occasionally insuring against loss
from rare but horrendous ""super-catastrophes.'' In much reinsurance sold by us,
other Berkshire subsidiaries have sold several times as much reinsurance to the same
customers on the same terms. In certain instances but not always, such subsidiaries
2


have taken from us a 3%-of-premiums ceding commission on premium volume
passed through them to Wes-FIC. Excepting this ceding commission, Wes-FIC has
had virtually no insurance-acquisition or insurance administration costs. In some
cases, other Berkshire subsidiaries act as reinsurers at higher levels than the level at
which Wes-FIC is reinsuring; terms of the reinsurance are considered by Wes-FIC to
be fair or advantageous to Wes-FIC.
For the past several years Wes-FIC's reinsurance activity has consisted of the
participation in two arrangements:
(1)
Participation in four risk pools managed by an insurance subsidiary of
Berkshire Hathaway, our 80%-owning parent, covering hull, liability, work-
ers' compensation and satellite exposures relating to the aviation industry
as follows: with respect to 2001, to the extent of 3% for each pool, with
satellite exposures eÅective June 1; for 2002, 13% of the hull and liability
pools, increasing to 15.5% in August, and 3% of the workers' compensa-
tion pool (satellite exposures were not renewed in June); and, for 2003
and 2004, 10% of the hull and liability pools only. The Berkshire subsidiary
provides a portion of the upper-level reinsurance protection to these
aviation risk pools, and therefore to Wes-FIC, on terms that could result in
the Berkshire subsidiary having a diÅerent interest from that of Wes-FIC
under certain conditions, e.g., in settling a large loss.
(2)
A multi-year contract entered into in 2000 through another Berkshire
insurance subsidiary, as intermediary without proÑt, covering certain
multi-line property and casualty risks of a large, unaÇliated insurer. This
contract was commuted (terminated) in the fourth quarter of 2004, at
which time Wes-FIC paid the ceding company $43.1 million, cash, repre-
senting all unearned premiums, reduced by unamortized costs and ex-
penses. After the commutation, Wes-FIC's obligation to indemnify any
further insurance losses under the contract ceased. Under that contract,
there was a net reduction in written premiums of $2.3 million for 2004,
compared with written premiums of $30.4 million for 2003; earned
premiums were $6.4 million for 2004 and $42.0 million for 2003.
Underwriting results of Wes-FIC in both 2004 and 2003 were weirdly favorable,
causing the underwriting gains of $14.6 million for 2004 and $15.7 million for 2003.
Such weirdly favorable results are not to be expected over the long term. It should
be recalled that Wes-FIC reported an underwriting loss of $8.1 million as recently as
2001. However, we do try to create some underwriting gain as results are averaged
out over many years.
Kansas Bankers was purchased by Wes-FIC in 1996 for approximately $80 mil-
lion in cash. Its tangible net worth now exceeds its acquisition price, and it has been
a very satisfactory acquisition, reÖecting the sound management of President Don
Towle and his team.
Kansas Bankers was chartered in 1909 to underwrite deposit insurance for
Kansas banks. Its oÇces are in Topeka, Kansas. Over the years its service has
continued to adapt to the changing needs of the banking industry. Today its
customer base, consisting mostly of small and medium-sized community banks, is
spread throughout 30 mainly midwestern states. In addition to bank deposit guaranty
bonds which insure deposits in excess of FDIC coverage, KBS oÅers directors and
3


oÇcers indemnity policies, bank employment practices policies, bank insurance
agents professional errors and omissions indemnity policies and Internet banking
catastrophe theft insurance.
KBS increased the volume of business retained eÅective in 1998. It had
previously ceded almost half of its premium volume to reinsurers. Now it reinsures
only about 14%. The increased volume of business retained comes, of course, with
increased irregularity in the income stream.
The combined ratio of an insurance company represents the percentage that its
underwriting losses and expenses bear to its premium revenues. KBS's combined
ratio has been much better than average for insurers, at 74.9% for 2004 and 65.0%
for 2003. We continue to expect volatile but favorable long-term eÅects from
increased insurance retained.
CORT Business Services Corporation (""CORT'')
In February 2000, Wesco purchased CORT Business Services Corporation
(""CORT'') for $386 million in cash.
CORT is a very long established company that is the country's leader in rentals
of furniture that lessees have no intention of buying. In the trade, people call CORT's
activity ""rent-to-rent'' to distinguish it from ""lease-to-purchase'' businesses that are,
in essence, installment sellers of furniture.
However, just as Hertz, as a rent-to-rent auto lessor in short-term arrangements,
must be skilled in selling used cars, CORT must be and is skilled in selling used
furniture.
CORT's revenues totaled $354 million for calendar 2004, versus $360 million for
calendar 2003. Of these amounts, furniture rental revenues were $275 million and
$276 million, furniture sales revenues were $68 million each year, and apartment
locator fees of Relocation Central Corporation, a business CORT started up in 2001,
were $11 million and $16 million. CORT operated at an after-tax proÑt of $5.0 mil-
lion for 2004; its operations resulted in an after-tax loss of $6.3 million for 2003; it
contributed $2.4 million and $13.1 million to Wesco's consolidated operating
income for 2002 and 2001. Recent results have been signiÑcantly worse than CORT's
$29 million of after-tax operating proÑts for the ten months that we owned it in 2000.
The Ñgures are before (1) goodwill amortization of $6.0 million for 2001 and
$5.1 million for 2000 (see discussion below), and (2) realized securities losses of
$.7 million in 2000, but include Relocation Central's after-tax losses of $7.4 million
for 2004, $9.0 million for 2003, $8.3 million for 2002 and $7.0 million for 2001.
Excluding the operating losses of Relocation Central, CORT, at the parent company
level, contributed $12.4 million to Wesco's consolidated after-tax operating earnings
for 2004, versus $2.7 million for 2003 and $10.7 million for 2002.
When we purchased CORT early in 2000, its furniture rental business was
rapidly growing, reÖecting the strong U.S. economy, phenomenal business expansion
and explosive growth of IPOs and the high-tech sector.
Beginning late in 2000, however, new business coming into CORT began to
decline. With the burst of the dot-com bubble, the events of September 11, and a
protracted slowdown in new business formation, CORT's operations have been
hammered, reÖecting generally bad results in the ""rent-to-rent'' segment of the
4


furniture rental business. Obviously, when we purchased CORT we were poor
predictors of near-term industry-wide prospects of the ""rent-to- rent'' sector of the
furniture business. It now appears that CORT's business has begun to rebound.
Furniture rental revenues for the fourth quarter of 2004 exceeded those for the
comparable quarter of 2003 by 13%, and, during the year the number of furniture
leases outstanding grew by 2%.
CORT started up a new subsidiary during 2001, Relocation Central Corporation,
which provides the nation's largest apartment locator service through its websites,
(www.relocationcentral.com and www.myrelocationcentral.com), customer call
centers and walk-in locations. This start-up venture did not progress as rapidly as
CORT expected and caused losses followed by some downsizing. More than 350
apartment communities now refer their tenants to CORT. Relocation Central was
reorganized to become a division of CORT as of yearend 2004; it now relies more on
Internet traÇc and less on separate, fully-staÅed facilities than previously. The
integration of Relocation Central into CORT was begun in 2003 as part of a program
to reduce CORT's costs and thus enhance its operating results. CORT still likes the
idea of having relocation services in its product mix.
We expect to report in due course that CORT's operations have become more
satisfactory. Even through the crash, CORT has operated at a positive cash flow, and
the general distress in its field has permitted various small expansions. During the past
four years it invested $74 million in business expansion through acquisitions of several
small businesses and reduced its line-of-credit and other debt by $33 million. CORT
remains the national leader in its market segment and we believe that these acquisi-
tions will prove to be satisfactory expansions of a fundamentally sound business.
When Wesco paid $386 million for CORT, about 60% of the purchase price was
attributable to goodwill, an intangible balance sheet asset.
Wesco's consolidated balance sheet now contains about $267 million in goodwill
(including $27 million from Wesco's 1996 purchase of KBS). The Financial Account-
ing Standards Board adopted a rule which became effective in 2002 that no longer
requires automatic amortization of acquired goodwill. (The requirement for such
amortization has been replaced by a standard that requires an annual assessment to
determine whether the value of goodwill has been impaired, in which event the
intangible would be written down or written off, as appropriate.) Earnings we have
reported since 2002 more closely reflect microeconomic reality as we appraise it.
CORT has long been headed by Paul Arnold, age 58, who is a star executive as is
convincingly demonstrated by his long record as CEO of CORT. We are absolutely
delighted to have Paul and CORT within Wesco. We continue to expect a considera-
ble expansion of CORT's business and earnings at some future time.
Precision Steel Warehouse, Inc. (""Precision Steel'')
The businesses of Wesco's Precision Steel subsidiary, headquartered in the
outskirts of Chicago at Franklin Park, Illinois, operated at an after-tax proÑt of
$1.1 million in 2004, versus an after-tax loss of $.9 million in 2003. The 2004 Ñgure
reÖects an after-tax LIFO inventory accounting adjustment decreasing after-tax
income by $1.8 million. In 2003 the LIFO adjustment was insigniÑcant. Precision
Steel's operating results for 2004 and 2003 also reÖect expenses of $.1 million and
5


$.7 million, after taxes, in connection with environmental cleanup of an industrial
park where a Precision Steel subsidiary has operated alongside approximately 15
other manufacturers for many years. Had it not been for the LIFO accounting
adjustment or the environmental matter, Precision Steel would have reported
operating income of $3.0 million, after taxes, for 2004, versus an operating loss of
$.2 million, after taxes, for 2003.
Prior to 2004, Precision Steel suÅered from a signiÑcant reduction in demand for
steel combined with intensiÑed competition for quite some time. Some of the sales
reduction was caused by customers' (or former customers') unsuccessful competi-
tion with manufacturers outside the United States. Although the 2004 Ñgures appear
to signal improvement, the severity of the domestic downturn is demonstrated by the
fact that Precision Steel's average annual steel service revenues for the years 2001
through 2003 were down 27% from those reported for 1998 through 2000. Even after
improved 2004 results, Precision Steel has not reported satisfactory operating results
in recent years. Its approximately-break-even after-tax operations for the most recent
four years compare unfavorably with operating proÑts which averaged $2.3 million,
after taxes, for the years 1998 through 2000.
Precision Steel endured a diÇcult and chaotic year in 2004. At the beginning of
2004, a shortage of raw materials from domestic mills produced near chaos in the
domestic steel service industry. Prices of those raw materials were sharply increased
and the price of Ñnished steel also increased sharply. Fortunately, the impact to date
on Precision Steel has been favorable. Its 2004 revenues increased 31.2%, from those
of 2003; pounds of steel products sold increased 14.5%. At present, domestic steel
mills have been operating at capacity and imported steel has not been readily
available. These and other factors have enabled steel mills to raise prices, place limits
on order quantities and extend delivery times. Precision Steel has reacted to these
pressures by passing the price increases, plus normal mark-ups, on to customers, and
favoring long-term customer relationships. However, we are concerned that the
favorable 2004 operating results may have been anomalous and temporary and that
the steel warehouse business may revert to diÇcult times.
Terry Piper, who became Precision Steel's President and Chief Executive OÇcer
late in 1999, has done an outstanding job in leading Precision Steel through very
diÇcult years.
Tag Ends from Savings and Loan Days
All that now remains outside Wes-FIC but within Wesco as a consequence of
Wesco's former involvement with Mutual Savings, Wesco's long-held savings and
loan subsidiary, is a small real estate subsidiary, MS Property Company, that holds tag
ends of appreciated real estate assets with a net book value of about $8.6 million,
consisting mainly of the nine-story commercial oÇce building in downtown
Pasadena, where Wesco is headquartered. MS Property Company's results of opera-
tions, immaterial versus Wesco's present size, are included in the breakdown of
earnings on page 1 within ""other operating earnings.''
6


Other Operating Earnings
Other operating earnings, net of interest paid and general corporate expenses,
amounted to $.4 million in 2004, unchanged from the $.4 million earned in 2003.
Sources were (1) rents ($3.4 million gross in 2004) from Wesco's Pasadena oÇce
property (leased almost entirely to outsiders, including Citibank as the ground Öoor
tenant), and (2) interest and dividends from cash equivalents and marketable
securities held outside the insurance subsidiaries, less (3) general corporate ex-
penses plus minor expenses involving tag-end real estate.
Consolidated Balance Sheet and Related Discussion
Wesco carries its investments at market value, with unrealized appreciation,
after income tax eÅect, included as a separate component of shareholders' equity,
and related taxes included in income taxes payable, in its consolidated balance
sheet. As indicated in the accompanying Ñnancial statements, Wesco's net worth, as
accountants compute it under their conventions, increased to $2.12 billion
($297 per Wesco share) at yearend 2004 from $2.08 billion ($292 per Wesco
share) at yearend 2003. The main cause of increase was net income after deduction
of dividends paid to shareholders.
The foregoing $297-per-share book value approximates liquidation value assum-
ing that all Wesco's non-security assets would liquidate, after taxes, at book value.
Of course, so long as Wesco does not liquidate, and does not sell any appreciated
securities, it has, in effect, an interest-free ""loan'' from the government equal to its
deferred income taxes on the unrealized gains, subtracted in determining its net
worth. This interest-free ""loan'' from the government is at this moment working for
Wesco shareholders and amounted to about $32 per Wesco share at yearend 2004.
However, some day, parts of the interest-free ""loan'' may be removed as
securities are sold. Therefore, Wesco's shareholders have no perpetual advantage
creating value for them of $32 per Wesco share. Instead, the present value of Wesco's
shareholders' advantage must logically be much lower than $32 per Wesco share.
Business and human quality in place at Wesco continues to be not nearly as
good, all factors considered, as that in place at Berkshire Hathaway. Wesco is not an
equally-good-but-smaller version of Berkshire Hathaway, better because its small
size makes growth easier. Instead, each dollar of book value at Wesco continues
plainly to provide much less intrinsic value than a similar dollar of book value at
Berkshire Hathaway. Moreover, the quality disparity in book value's intrinsic merits
has, in recent years, continued to widen in favor of Berkshire Hathaway.
All that said, we make no attempt to appraise relative attractiveness for invest-
ment of Wesco versus Berkshire Hathaway stock at present stock-market quotations.
To progress from this point at a satisfactory rate, Wesco plainly needs more
favorable investment opportunities, recognizable as such by its management, prefer-
ably in whole companies, but, alternatively, in marketable securities to be purchased
by Wesco's insurance subsidiaries. Our views regarding the general prospects for
investment in common stocks are unchanged two years after Warren BuÅett wrote
the following, in his 2002 annual report to shareholders of our parent company:
""We continue to do little in equities. ®We© are increasingly comfortable
with our holdings in ®our© major investees because most of them have in-
creased their earnings while their valuations have decreased. But we are not
7


inclined to add to them. Though these enterprises have good prospects, we
don't yet believe their shares are undervalued.
""In our view, the same conclusion Ñts stocks generally. Despite three years
of falling prices, which have signiÑcantly improved the attractiveness of com-
mon stocks, we still Ñnd very few that even mildly interest us. That dismal fact is
testimony to the insanity of valuations reached during The Great Bubble.
Unfortunately, the hangover may prove to be proportional to the binge.
""The aversion to equities that ®we© exhibit today is far from congenital. We
love owning common stocks Ì if they can be purchased at attractive prices. In
®my© 61 years of investing, 50 or so years have offered that kind of opportunity.
There will be years like that again. Unless, however, we see a very high probability
of at least 10% pre-tax returns (which translates to 61/2-7% after corporate tax), we
will sit on the sidelines. With short-term money returning less than 1% after-tax,
sitting it out is no fun. But occasionally successful investing requires inactivity.''
In fact, the one thing that should interest Wesco shareholders most with respect
to 2004 is that, as in 2003, 2002 and 2001, Wesco found no new common stocks for
our insurance companies to buy.
Shareholders should note that the recently announced sale of The Gillette
Company to The Procter and Gamble Company, subject to shareholder approval
later in 2005, is expected to result in Wesco's recognition of an investment gain of
about $190 million, after income taxes. No income taxes will be paid in cash, and all
of Wesco's Gillette shares will be converted into Procter and Gamble shares.
Although we will be pleased to become owners of shares of Procter and Gamble, we
do not regard this ""mere accounting'' gain as signiÑcant to Wesco shareholders.
The Board of Directors recently increased Wesco's regular dividend from 341/2
cents per share to 351/2 cents per share, payable March 2, 2005, to shareholders of
record as of the close of business on February 2, 2005.
This annual report contains Form 10-K, a report Ñled with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, and includes detailed information about Wesco and its
subsidiaries as well as audited Ñnancial statements bearing extensive footnotes. As
usual, your careful attention is sought with respect to these items.
Shareholders can access much Wesco information, including printed annual
reports, earnings releases, SEC Ñlings, and the websites of Wesco's subsidiaries and
parent, Berkshire Hathaway, from Wesco's website: www.wescoÑnancial.com.
We regret the pending retirement of Wesco's President, Bob Bird, who is not
standing for reelection. He has been, in eÅect, my partner for over 35 years and has
never failed in giving wise and diligent service.
