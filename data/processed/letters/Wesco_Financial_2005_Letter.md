WESCO FINANCIAL CORPORATION
LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS
To Our Shareholders:
Consolidated net ""operating'' income (i.e., before realized investment gains
shown in the table below) for the calendar year 2005 increased to $77,973,000
($10.95 per share) from $47,427,000 ($6.66 per share) in the previous year.
Consolidated net income increased to $294,579,000 ($41.37 per share) from
$47,427,000 ($6.66 per share) in the previous year.
Wesco has four major subsidiaries: (1) Wesco-Financial Insurance Company

All Ñgures are net of income taxes.
(2)
Per-share data are based on 7,119,807 shares outstanding. Wesco has had no dilutive capital stock equivalents.
(3)
Represents income from ownership of the Wesco headquarters oÇce building, primarily leased to outside tenants, and
interest and dividend income from cash equivalents and marketable securities owned outside the insurance subsidiaries, less
interest and other corporate expenses.

Includes $216,112,000 ($30.35 per share) from the tax-free exchange of Wesco's common shares in The Gillette Company
for common shares in The Procter & Gamble Company in connection with the merger of Gillette with Procter & Gamble.
Although no cash was received, generally accepted accounting principles require that the gain be recorded. Because
Wesco's balance sheet reÖects investments carried at market value, with unrealized gains, after applicable income tax eÅect,
included in shareholders' equity, the transaction did not aÅect Wesco's shareholders' equity. It merely resulted in a
reclassiÑcation from unrealized gains to retained earnings, another component of shareholders' equity.
This supplementary breakdown of earnings diÅers somewhat from that used in audited
Ñnancial statements which follow standard accounting convention. The foregoing
supplementary breakdown is furnished because it is considered useful to shareholders.

The total consolidated net income shown above is, of course, identical to the total in
our audited Ñnancial statements.
Insurance Businesses
Consolidated operating earnings from insurance businesses represent the combi-
nation of the results of their insurance underwriting (premiums earned, less insurance
losses, loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses) with their investment
income. Following is a summary of these Ñgures as they pertain to all insurance
operations (in 000s).

As shown above, operating income includes signiÑcant net investment income,
representing dividends and interest earned from marketable securities. However,
operating income excludes investment gains of $216.6 million, net of income taxes,
realized in 2005. No investment gains or losses were realized in 2004. The discussion
below will concentrate on insurance underwriting, not on the results from investments.
Wes-FIC engages in the reinsurance business, occasionally insuring against loss
from rare but horrendous ""super-catastrophes.'' In much reinsurance sold by us, other
Berkshire subsidiaries have sold several times as much reinsurance to the same
customers on the same terms. In certain instances but not always, such subsidiaries
have taken from us a 3%-of-premiums ceding commission on premium volume passed
through them to Wes-FIC. Excepting this ceding commission, Wes-FIC has had
virtually no insurance-acquisition or insurance administration costs. In some cases,
other Berkshire subsidiaries act as reinsurers at higher levels than the level at which
Wes-FIC is reinsuring; terms of the reinsurance are considered to be fair or advanta-
geous to Wes-FIC.
For the past several years Wes-FIC's reinsurance activity has consisted of the
participation in two arrangements described below, the second of which was termi-
nated in the fourth quarter of 2004:
(1)
Participation, since 2001, in several risk pools managed by an insurance
subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, our 80%-owning parent, recently covering
hull, liability and workers' compensation exposures relating to the aviation
industry as follows: for 2004, to the extent of 10% in the hull and liability
pools; for 2005, 10% of the hull and liability pools and 5% of the workers'
compensation pool. For 2006, participation in the hull and liability pools has
increased to 121/2 %. The Berkshire subsidiary provides a portion of the
upper-level reinsurance protection to these aviation risk pools on terms that
could result in the Berkshire subsidiary having a diÅerent interest from that of
Wes-FIC under certain conditions, e.g., in settling a large loss.
(2)
A multi-year contract entered into in 2000 through another Berkshire insur-
ance subsidiary, as intermediary without proÑt, covering certain multi-line
property and casualty risks of a large, unaÇliated insurer. This contract was
commuted in the fourth quarter of 2004, at which time Wes-FIC paid the
ceding company $43.1 million, cash, representing all unearned premiums,
reduced by unamortized costs and expenses. After the commutation, Wes-
FIC's obligation to indemnify any further insurance losses under the contract
ceased. Under that contract for 2004, there was a net reduction in written
premiums of $2.3 million; earned premiums were $6.4 million, and under-
writing gain was $11.0 million ($7.2 million, after income taxes).
Wes-FIC's underwriting results have Öuctuated from year to year, but have been
satisfactory. When stated as a percentage, the sum of insurance losses, loss adjustment
expenses and underwriting expenses, divided by premiums, gives the combined ratio.
The combined ratios of Wes-FIC have been much better than average for insurers.
Excluding the unusual beneÑcial eÅects caused by the commuted contract in 2004,
Wes-FIC's combined ratios were 75.9% for 2005 and 77.8% for 2004. Although we
have an appetite for unusually large risks when prices are satisfactory, thus subjecting
3


Wes-FIC to signiÑcant periodic underwriting losses, we try to create some underwriting
gain as results are averaged out over many years.
Kansas Bankers was purchased by Wes-FIC in 1996 for approximately $80 million
in cash. Its tangible net worth now exceeds its acquisition price, and it has been a very
satisfactory acquisition, reÖecting the sound management of President Don Towle and
his team.
Kansas Bankers was chartered in 1909 to underwrite deposit insurance for Kansas
banks. Its oÇces are in Topeka, Kansas. Over the years its service has continued to
adapt to the changing needs of the banking industry. Today its customer base,
consisting mostly of small and medium-sized community banks, is spread throughout
30 mainly midwestern states. In addition to bank deposit guaranty bonds which insure
deposits in excess of FDIC coverage, KBS oÅers directors and oÇcers indemnity
policies, bank employment practices policies, bank insurance agents professional errors
and omissions indemnity policies and Internet banking catastrophe theft insurance.
KBS increased the volume of business retained eÅective in 1998. It had previously
ceded almost half of its premium volume to reinsurers. Now it reinsures only about
13%. The increased volume of business retained comes, of course, with increased
irregularity in the income stream. KBS's combined ratios were 58.8% for 2005 and
74.9% for 2004. We continue to expect volatile but favorable long-term eÅects from
increased insurance retained.
CORT Business Services Corporation (""CORT'')
In February 2000, Wesco purchased CORT Business Services Corporation
(""CORT'') for $386 million in cash.
CORT is a very long established company that is the country's leader in rentals of
furniture that lessees have no intention of buying. In the trade, people call CORT's
activity ""rent-to-rent'' to distinguish it from ""lease-to-purchase'' businesses that are, in
essence, installment sellers of furniture.
However, just as Hertz, as a rent-to-rent auto lessor in short-term arrangements,
must be skilled in selling used cars, CORT must be and is skilled in selling used
furniture.
CORT's revenues totaled $384 million for calendar 2005, versus $354 million for
calendar 2004. Of these amounts, furniture rental revenues were $304 million and
$275 million, furniture sales revenues were $72 million and $68 million, and apartment
locator fees of its Relocation Central division, a business CORT started up in 2001,
were $8 million and $11 million. CORT operated at an after-tax proÑt of $20.7 million
for 2005, up satisfactorily from its after-tax proÑt of $5.0 million for 2004. These results
reÖect the favorable eÅects of several selective acquisitions.
When we purchased CORT early in 2000, its furniture rental business was rapidly
growing, reÖecting the strong U.S. economy, phenomenal business expansion and
explosive growth of IPOs and the high-tech sector.
Beginning late in 2000, however, new business coming into CORT began to
decline. With the burst of the dot-com bubble, the events of September 11, and a
protracted slowdown in new business formation, CORT's operations were hammered,
4


reÖecting generally bad results in the ""rent-to-rent'' segment of the furniture rental
business. Obviously, when we purchased CORT we were poor predictors of near-term
industry-wide prospects of the ""rent-to-rent'' sector of the furniture business.
CORT started up a new subsidiary during 2001, Relocation Central, which provides
a
large
national
apartment
locator
service
through
its
websites,
(www.relocationcentral.com and www.myrelocationcentral.com), customer call cen-
ters and walk-in locations. This start-up venture did not progress as rapidly as CORT
expected and caused losses followed by some downsizing. Relocation Central was
reorganized to become a division of CORT as of yearend 2004; it now relies more on
Internet traÇc and less on separate, fully-staÅed facilities. The integration of Relocation
Central into CORT was begun in 2003 as part of a program to reduce CORT's costs and
thus enhance its operating results. CORT still likes the idea of having relocation
services in its product mix. Almost twenty thousand apartment communities now refer
their tenants to CORT.
We are pleased with the progress CORT made in 2005. We are cautiously
optimistic that, in future years, we will be able to look back to the recent past and
consider it merely a cyclical aberration in CORT's growth. We note, however, that the
number of furniture leases outstanding as of yearend 2005 has fallen by about 4% from
those one year earlier.
When Wesco paid $386 million for CORT, about 60% of the purchase price was
attributable to goodwill, an intangible balance sheet asset. Wesco's consolidated
balance sheet now contains about $267 million in goodwill (including $27 million from
Wesco's 1996 purchase of KBS). The Financial Accounting Standards Board adopted a
rule which became eÅective in 2002 that no longer requires automatic amortization of
acquired goodwill. (The requirement for such amortization has been replaced by a
standard that requires an annual assessment to determine whether the value of
goodwill has been impaired, in which event the intangible asset would be written down
or written oÅ, as appropriate.) Earnings we have reported since 2002 more closely
reÖect microeconomic reality as we appraise it.
More details with respect to CORT are contained throughout this annual report, to
which your careful attention is directed.
CORT has long been headed by Paul Arnold, age 59, who is a star executive as is
convincingly demonstrated by his long record as CEO of CORT. We are absolutely
delighted to have Paul and CORT within Wesco.
Precision Steel Warehouse, Inc. (""Precision Steel'')
The businesses of Wesco's Precision Steel subsidiary, headquartered in the out-
skirts of Chicago at Franklin Park, Illinois, operated at after-tax proÑts of $1.2 million in
2005 and $1.1 million in 2004. These Ñgures reÖect after-tax LIFO inventory accounting
adjustments decreasing after-tax income by $.2 million for 2005 and $1.8 million for
2004. Precision Steel's operating results for 2004 also reÖect expenses of $.2 million,
after taxes, in connection with environmental cleanup of an industrial park where a
Precision Steel subsidiary has operated alongside approximately 15 other manufactur-
ers for many years. Had it not been for the LIFO accounting adjustment or the
environmental matter, Precision Steel would have reported after-tax operating income
of $1.3 million for 2005 and $3.0 million for 2004.
5


Precision Steel's business has been subject to economic cycles. Precision Steel has
increasingly suÅered from intensiÑed competition resulting from a reduction in demand
caused by customers' (or former customers') unsuccessful competition with manufac-
turers outside the United States. At the beginning of 2004, a shortage of raw materials
from domestic mills produced near chaos in the domestic steel service industry.
Domestic mills were operating at capacity and imported steel was not readily available.
These and other factors enabled steel mills to raise prices, place limits on order
quantities and extend delivery times. Prices of those raw materials were sharply
increased and the price of Ñnished steel also increased sharply. Customers of Precision
Steel increased their purchases to counter allocations imposed by mills and other
suppliers. Precision Steel successfully passed the price increases, plus normal mark-
ups, on to customers while favoring long-term customer relationships. Precision Steel's
2004 revenues increased 31.2% from those of 2003; pounds of steel products sold
increased 14.5%. Throughout 2005, raw material supplies remained very tight, but
competitive pressures increased as demand softened, possibly reÖecting customers'
absorption in their manufacturing processes of accelerated purchases made in 2004 in
reaction to the chaotic market conditions. In 2005, pounds of steel products sold by
Precision Steel decreased 8.6% from those of 2004, but revenues increased 1.4%,
reÖecting mainly 40%-higher average selling prices than those prevailing two years
earlier. We are concerned that the favorable operating results experienced by Precision
in the two most recent years may have been anomalous and temporary and that the
steel warehouse business may revert to diÇcult times.
Although Precision Steel's figures for each of the past two years may signal
improvement when compared with its after-tax operating loss of $.9 million for 2003 and
$.3 million of income for 2002, it should be noted that conditions currently facing the
steel service industry continue to be in a state of flux. The severity of the domestic
downturn in the steel service industry is demonstrated by the fact that Precision Steel's
average annual steel service revenues for the years 2001 through 2003 were down 27%
from those reported for 1998 through 2000. Considering the improved earnings for 2004
and 2005, Precision Steel has still not reported satisfactory operating results in recent
years. Its recent earnings compare unfavorably with operating profits which averaged
$2.3 million, after taxes, for the years 1998 through 2000.
Terry Piper, who became Precision Steel's President and Chief Executive Officer in
1999, has done an outstanding job in leading Precision Steel through very difficult years.
Tag Ends from Savings and Loan Days
All that now remains outside Wes-FIC but within Wesco as a consequence of
Wesco's former involvement with Mutual Savings, Wesco's long-held savings and loan
subsidiary, is a small real estate subsidiary, MS Property Company, that holds tag ends
of appreciated real estate assets consisting mainly of the nine-story commercial oÇce
building in downtown Pasadena, where Wesco is headquartered. Adjacent to that
building is a parcel of land on which we have begun to build a multi-story luxury
condominium building. We are also seeking city approval of our plans to build another
multi-story luxury condominium building on a vacant parcel of land in the next block.
We have recently begun to take reservations. Simply phone Bob Sahm (626-585-
6700) for more information. MS Property Company's results of operations, immaterial
versus Wesco's present size, are included in the breakdown of earnings on page 1
within ""other operating earnings.''
6


Other Operating Earnings
Other operating earnings, net of interest paid and general corporate expenses,
amounted to $5.2 million in 2005, up from the $.4 million earned in 2004. Ignoring
favorable income tax adjustments of $4.9 million, the sources of the $.3 million of
earnings in 2005 were (1) rents ($3.5 million gross in 2005) from Wesco's Pasadena
oÇce property (leased almost entirely to outsiders, including Citibank as the ground
Öoor tenant), and (2) interest and dividends from cash equivalents and marketable
securities held outside the insurance subsidiaries, less (3) general corporate expenses
plus minor expenses involving tag-end real estate.
Realized Investment Gains
Wesco's 2005 earnings contained investment gains of $216.6 million, after income
taxes. There were no realized investment gains in 2004. Of the 2005 gains, only
$.5 million was realized through the sale of investments; the balance, $216.1 million,
resulted from the tax-free exchange of common shares of The Gillette Company
(""Gillette'') owned by Wesco, for common shares of The Procter & Gamble Company
(""P&G'') in the fourth quarter of 2005 in connection with the merger of Gillette with
P&G. Accounting standards promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board
require that the fair (market) value of shares received in such an exchange be recorded
as the new cost basis as of the date of the exchange, with the difference between the
new basis and the historical cost realized in the audited financial statements as an
investment gain. For tax return purposes the exchange is recorded at the original cost of
the securities exchanged; no gain is reported, and no taxes are yet due.
Although the realized gain had a material impact on Wesco's reported earnings, it
had no impact on Wesco's shareholders' equity. Wesco carries its investments at fair
value, with unrealized appreciation, after income tax eÅect, included as a separate
component of shareholders' equity, and related taxes included in income taxes
payable, on its consolidated balance sheet. Thus, the entire after-tax gain on the non-
cash merger had been reÖected in the unrealized gain component of Wesco's
shareholders' equity as of September 30, 2005. That amount was merely switched from
unrealized gain to retained earnings, another component of shareholders' equity. This
accounting entry had no economic eÅect on Wesco, and you should ignore it when
you are evaluating Wesco's 2005 earnings.
Consolidated Balance Sheet and Related Discussion
As indicated in the accompanying Ñnancial statements, Wesco's net worth, as
accountants compute it under their conventions, increased to $2.23 billion ($313 per
Wesco share) at yearend 2005 from $2.12 billion ($297 per Wesco share) at yearend
2004. The main cause of the increase was net operating income after deduction of
dividends paid to shareholders.
The foregoing $313-per-share book value approximates liquidation value assuming
that all Wesco's non-security assets would liquidate, after taxes, at book value.
Of course, so long as Wesco does not liquidate, and does not sell any appreciated
securities, including the P&G shares Wesco received in connection with P&G's
acquisition of Gillette, discussed above in the section, ""Realized Investment Gains,''
Wesco has, in eÅect, an interest-free ""loan'' from the government equal to its deferred
income taxes, subtracted in determining its net worth. This interest-free ""loan'' from
7


the government is at this moment working for Wesco shareholders and amounted to
about $36 per Wesco share at yearend 2005.
However, some day, parts of the interest-free ""loan'' may be removed as securities
are sold. Therefore, Wesco's shareholders have no perpetual advantage creating value
for them of $36 per Wesco share. Instead, the present value of Wesco's shareholders'
advantage must logically be much lower than $36 per Wesco share.
Business and human quality in place at Wesco continues to be not nearly as good,
all factors considered, as that in place at Berkshire Hathaway. Wesco is not an equally-
good-but-smaller version of Berkshire Hathaway, better because its small size makes
growth easier. Instead, each dollar of book value at Wesco continues plainly to provide
much less intrinsic value than a similar dollar of book value at Berkshire Hathaway.
Moreover, the quality disparity in book value's intrinsic merits has, in recent years,
continued to widen in favor of Berkshire Hathaway.
All that said, we make no attempt to appraise relative attractiveness for investment
of Wesco versus Berkshire Hathaway stock at present stock-market quotations.
Wesco's consolidated balance sheet reÖects total assets of $2.7 billion as of
yearend 2005. Of that amount, more than $1 billion has been invested in cash
equivalents and Ñxed-maturity investments since early in 2003. Unless those funds can
be attractively reinvested in acquisitions, equity securities or other long-term instru-
ments of the type that have been responsible for the long-term growth of Wesco's
shareholders' equity, future returns on shareholders' equity will probably be less than
those of the past. Due to the current size of Wesco and its parent, Berkshire Hathaway,
Wesco's opportunities for growing shareholders' equity are unlikely to be as attractive
as in the past.
The Board of Directors recently increased Wesco's regular dividend from 351/2
cents per share to 361/2 cents per share, payable March 2, 2006, to shareholders of
record as of the close of business on February 1, 2006.
This annual report contains Form 10-K, a report Ñled with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, and includes detailed information about Wesco and its subsidi-
aries as well as audited Ñnancial statements bearing extensive footnotes. As usual, your
careful attention is sought with respect to these items.
Shareholders can access much Wesco information, including printed annual
reports, earnings releases, SEC Ñlings, and the websites of Wesco's subsidiaries and
parent, Berkshire Hathaway, from Wesco's website: www.wescoÑnancial.com.
